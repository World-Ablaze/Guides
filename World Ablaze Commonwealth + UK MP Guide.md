# COMMONWEALTH STRATEGY for MP (WORLD ABLAZE)

## Introduction:
This document is an attempt to summarize a coherent strategy for the
Commonwealth war effort up to mid 1941 to deal with convoy raiding, Italian East Africa and the
defense of Egypt. This strategy assumes that:

* The Italian player will build up Italian East Africa to defend it and use it as a base for
offensive operations with fighters, TAC bombers, subs and infantry.
* France falls between May and August 1940.
 The Axis will make a serious effort at taking the Middle East
* The Axis will use either subs or surface raiders to attack convoys or both.
* The Germany and Italy players are competent.

Definite roles are assigned to each player to make the most out of each nation’s resources,
allow for doctrine specialization and to complement each other. The UK player cannot micro the
air, sea and land war on his own so his infantry is mostly defensive, leaving attacks and
counter-attacks to the minors. The same applies to anti submarine warfare (ASW) and raiding
which is the remit of minors, This leaves the UK to manage air superiority and surface fleet
actions.

# CANADA

Role: Commonwealth medium tank force and sub hunter

###  Navy:

* Put the existing destroyers on permanent training to get XP. When war starts, put
them on convoy raiding around SAF if the Axis are still trading with Asia or
around Ethiopia.

* Get the license of the cheap Hawkins from Australia and build one to make it the
Pride of the Fleet for war support.

* Research sonar, radar, K-guns and Frigates up to the Hunt class. Research Hunt
class once the Degauss Hulls focus has been taken.

* Produce convoys until the Hunt class is available. Modify the Hunt by removing
everything except one single gun battery and the ASW equipment. Add Sonar 2
and Radar 3. This makes it significantly cheaper to produce.

* Produce as many Hunt frigates as possible and deploy them in fleets of 4 on
patrol orders in sea zones attacked by submarines. Take the admiral traits that
reduce visibility and help retreat.

* Take appropriate navy doctrine for submarine detection.

* Research aerial minelaying and with obsolete lend-leased TAC bombers from UK
and France lay mines in ocean and deep oceans threatened by subs.
###  Air:

* Research and produce Patrol (5-10 mils) aircraft only. They help significantly in
locating sub fleets and killing them.

* Take appropriate air doctrine for naval missions.
### Army:

* As a priority, take the army foci that give you a mechanized bonus of 300% and
research it. Put four mils on it. You will be supplying SAF with them as well as
your own armoured divisions.

* Research cruiser tanks and upgrade with Horstmann suspension.

* Produce medium tanks and close support medium tanks and convert your
mechanized template to 6 mechanized, 6 medium tanks and 3 close support
tanks. Support companies: armoured recon, assault eng, heavy artillery, signals,
heavy motorized maintenance, motorized hospital, motorized logistics, heavy AA.

* You should have time to deploy at least one, possibly two medium tank divisions
to Egypt by the fall of France.

* Take appropriate army doctrine for tanks (right then left) and infantry (centre then
left)

# SOUTH AFRICA

Role: Commonwealth heavy tank force and submarine convoy raider

### Navy:

*  Get license for S class submarine from UK and produce it with your dockyards.

*  Take appropriate navy doctrine for commerce raiding by subs.

### Air:
No SAF air

### Army:

* Research heavy tanks continuously. Once you have the Matilda II tank, research
the Close support version and use the tank bonus from the focus on the Churchill

* When you have the Maltida II, put all your mils on it. UK and other
Commonwealth minors will supply you with any other equipment you need.

* Use your Motorized template to build a heavy tank division with 6 mechanized, 6
heavy and 3 heavy close support tank battalions. Support companies: armoured
recon, assault eng, heavy artillery, signals, heavy motorized maintenance,
motorized hospital, motorized logistics, heavy AA.

* You should have time to deploy one to Egypt for the fall of France and a second
one soon after.

* Take appropriate army doctrine for tanks (right then left) and infantry (centre then
left)

# AUSTRALIA

Role: Commonwealth assault infantry, surface raider hunter, CAS air force

### Navy:

* Train your fleet. Use the XP to remove the AA and torpedoes from the Hawkins
heavy cruiser to get under the production cap. Build 4 of these then Leander light
cruisers.

* Create another variant of the Hawkins for Canada and remove all but one of the
guns to make it as cheap as possible.

* When war starts, refit the Hawkins with better fire controls, radar and torpedoes
before the fall of France.

* Take appropriate navy doctrine for capital ships, damage control and fire control.
### Air:

* As soon as world tension reaches 50%, take the CAC Woomera focus and
produce the Attacker Woomera plane (10 mils). Use these for CAS, bomber
interception and naval combat in Africa and the Mediterranean.

* Take appropriate support doctrine for ground support and then naval missions.

### Army:

* Research and produce the best heavy artillery and heavy infantry equipment as
soon as possible. You will also need to produce trucks.

* Replace the artillery battalions in your infantry division template with heavy
artillery and convert all the light infantry to infantry.. Support companies:
armoured recon, assault eng, heavy artillery, signals, motorized maintenance,
motorized hospital, motorized logistics, heavy AA.

* Convert all existing units to the infantry division template. Replace the artillery
battalions in your infantry divisions with heavy artillery. Add one AT battalion.
Support companies: armoured recon, assault eng, heavy artillery, signals,
motorized maintenance, motorized hospital, motorized logistics, heavy AA.

* Take infantry (centre and left) and artillery (left and left) doctrine.

# BRITISH RAJ

Role: Commonwealth defensive infantry and minelaying fleet

###  Navy:

* License the cheap Bitern frigate from the UK and produce it continuously until
the Canadians have the upgraded Hunt frigate. License the Hunt and produce it.
This will give you a small convoy escort fleet and a limited ASW capability which
should be enough to deal with Italian and then Japanese subs.

### Air: No air.

### Army:

* Put 5 mils on light infantry equipment and one on trains.

* Train the maximum number of armour divisions then convert the infantry divisions
to armour divisions. Remove one of the infantry battalions as soon as possible
from the armour template.

* Manually deploy the armour divisions as soon as possible.

*  Periodically convert the divisions from armour to infantry to reach the threshold to
train reserve divisions (you need 200k more men in the field for every 10 reserve
divisions trained). You should get between reserve 80-100 divisions trained.

* When war is declared, deploy the reserve infantry divisions, delete the armoured
divisions and then train the maximum number of 25 width mountaineers allowed
by your special forces cap.

* Improve relations with Switzerland, Netherlands, Belgium, Yugoslavia, Denmark,
Sweden and Norway. This will allow you to get lend-lease equipment for your
reserve divisions that deploy at 50% equipment. You can also get equipment
from the Baltic countries and Finland and Bulgaria if AI controlled.

* Take the infantry (right and left) and artillery (left and left) doctrines.

# UNITED KINGDOM

Role: Commonwealth convoy escort and naval superiority, air superiority air force and defensive
infantry.

### Navy:

* Put the aircraft carrier and Town light cruisers production lines on infinite
production.

* Train your fleet and use the XP to remove everything from the Bitern frigate
except the depth charge and single gun battery. Upgrade sonar to active sonar,
When dockyards become available, put them to producing the cheap Bitern and
select the Yarrow Shipbuilder advisors for 20% reduction in cost. Produce
200-300. These will be on convoy escort to protect convoys, not to hunt subs.

* Research the basic fire control around 1937 and research the Illustrious carrier.
Select the decision to put 4 x Illustrious carriers in production. Finish production
of light cruisers and transfer dockyards to the carriers to finish them by the end of 39.

* Research radar and electronics continuously. You will need radar 3 and fire
control 3 research in 39 to upgrade your capital ships and cruisers before the fall
of France.

* Take doctrines for the capital ships and carriers first then fire control and damage
control and last convoy escort (screening, not sub detection).

### Air:

*  Put all fighters and carrier fighters on permanent training to get XP.

*  Research fighters continuously until you get the Spitfire. Use your XP to fully
upgrade it. As soon as it is available, put all new mils on producing it, Remove
excess mils from other production lines and add to the Spitfire.

* Research the Beaufort attacker as soon as possible to use as an interceptor and
in case of emergencies as CAS and against ships. (put 5 to 10 mils on it).
* Take fighter doctrines.

### Army:

*  Research artillery and anti-tank. Replace the light infantry battalions with heavy
infantry then duplicate the infantry division template. Add three battalions of AT to
the infantry division template.Support companies: armoured recon, assault eng,
heavy artillery, signals, motorized hospital, motorized logistics, AA and heavy AA.
These will be the field divisions in Egypt defending the front lines.

*  With the duplicate of the template, add one heavy infantry battalion and one AT
battalion. Support companies: armoured recon, assault eng, heavy artillery,
signals,motorized logistics, AA and heavy AA. These are the divisions that will
hold Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus.

* Hold the UK with the reserve divisions on the ports and the Home Guard on the
coast, VP and air bases.

* Take the infantry (left and left) and artillery (left and left) doctrines.

### NAVAL STRATEGY

1. Convoy escort:

*  UK is responsible for deploying cheap frigates in fleets of 20 to 30 units with
convoy escort orders on threatened trade routes worldwide.

* All Allies to close down sea zones (red). All but the UK to limit access (yellow) to
Channel and North sea as per the map below:

2. Sub hunting:

* Canada to deploy fleets of 4 x Hunt frigates in sea zones being attacked by subs
with patrol orders in the Atlantic. They should also deploy them in the Indian
Ocean if the Raj navy can’t cope with subs.

* Canada to deploy Patrol aircraft in wings of 100 units over sea zones being
attacked.

* Other players to keep Canada informed of location of sub attacks.
3. Surface raiders:

*  UK to hunt down surface raiders in the Atlantic with fleets of 1 battle cruiser, 2
heavy cruisers and 4 light cruisers with 30kn speed minimum.

* Australia to hunt down surface raiders in the Indian Ocean with fleets of 2 heavy
cruisers and 4 light cruisers.

* Use choke points like the Cape Verde Plain and Cape of Africa with patrols of
cheap destroyers with radar on high risk orders.to detect and intercept surface
raiders. Use patrol aircraft, and land based radars to help detection. Have a
strike force fleet in a nearby port to help the destroyers once they engage the
surface raiders. If it doesn’t get there in time, switch the strike force to patrol
orders.

* If necessary build air bases and radars on islands to base patrol aircraft. These
will help locate the surface raiders for your patrolling fleets.

4. Minelaying:

* Use minelaying subs in shallow seas around the UK once war is declared. This
can most usefully be done by France building cheap subs pre-war but it’s
probably worth the UK building some too and a few minesweepers to counter Axis minelayers.

5. Convoy raiding:

* UK to deploy subs around Ethiopia before the fall of France to prevent meme
invasions. Move them back a sea zone or two if Italian TAC bombers are causing
casualties as long as the port in Yemen is garrisoned.

* SAF to deploy subs in Egypt and convoy raid the Mediterranean with Attacker
and Patrol planes in support when German units are likely to cross to Africa. UK
can locate old subs near Italian and Greek ports with no orders to give advance
warning of the arrival of German units.

# AIR STRATEGY
1. UK to provide air cover in France and the UK.

2. When Italy enters the war, air cover is to be extended to Egypt, Gibraltar, Malta and
Ethiopia. Italian TAC bombers will need to be intercepted by heavy fighters or attackers.

3. UK to deploy CAS and Australia Attackers in Egypt and around Ethiopia in support of
land units.

4. Canada to deploy Patrol aircraft against subs first, then surface raiders and last
offensively against convoys depending on the threat.

5. UK attackers to be kept in reserve in the UK as interceptors against bombers.

# LAND STRATEGY

1. UK to deploy 4 garrison divisions in Cyprus, Malta and Gibraltar and the field divisions in
Egypt near El Alamein. Reserve divisions in the UK on ports and Home Guard on the
coast, VPs and air bases,

2. Australian infantry, Canadian medium tanks and SAF heavy tanks in Egypt in a second
line to counter-attack against breakthroughs.

3. Sufficient Raj reserve divisions to be deployed around Ethiopia to contain it. This will be
dependent on available supply. Use the mountaineers to attack but only with air
superiority and with supply.

4. SAF to leave one infantry division on each port in SAF. Raj to leave one division in each
port in India, Ceylon, Yemen, Kuwait and around Saudi Arabia to protect against meme
naval invasions.

5. Raj to deploy 4 infantry units per port in Egypt and Palestine. These must be fully
equipped so put them in a new theater with high supply priority.

6. Attack Irak with Raj and Australian units as soon as possible after war is declared. By
following the UK build strategy, if Egypt is lost the Allies can defend the two mountain
ranges in Jordan or in the worst case scenario evacuate units through Sinai and Jordan
escape ports or Kuwait.

# UK BUILD STRATEGY
Before the UK reaches Partial Mobilization:

1. Build up infrastructure in Kenya, Somaliland, Khartoum, Aswan and Jordan to level 5.
Remove the agrarian state modifier (25pp) where you are going to build railways or other
buildings. Definitely remove the modifier before war starts.

2. Extend the railway from Aswan to Khartoum once the agrarian state modifier is removed

3. When the above is done (mostly while at civilian economy) and when you switch to early
mobilization build mils only.

### After war is declared:

1. Build up the naval base in Somaliland to level 4.

2. Build escape naval bases in the tip of Sinai and Jordan.

3. Once Irak is conquered, extend the railway from Jordan to Iraq and build a supply dump
in the Jordan desert tile on the Iraq border.

4. Build radars in Northern Ireland, Northern Scotland, Yemen, Khartoum.

5. Build land forts in El Alamein.

# STRATEGY AFTER JULY 1941
This will depend on the evolution of the war in Africa and the progress of Japan in China.

If Japan is ready for war in 1941 then most Raj units will have to return home to be in place and
fully entrenched by November 1941. Where possible Canada and SAF should provide armoured
divisions composed mostly of obsolete close support tanks as a reserve to deal with naval
invasions or breakthroughs in Burma.

If Italian East Africa is still in Italian hands, it will have to
be screened off in Sudan and Kenya with enough Raj troops to contain the Italians until US
troops can help. Trade space for time in Kenya as there is nothing of value there.
