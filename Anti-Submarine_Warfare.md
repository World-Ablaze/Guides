# Anti-Submarine Warfare in World Ablaze
Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) in the World Ablaze (WA) mod differs slightly from vanilla as all
escort ships in vanilla are termed either Destroyers (DD) or Light Cruisers (CL). In WA there is a
third class of smaller escort vessels: Frigates (FF). Long range planes also have a third class
called Patrol Aircraft (PA) which are better than Heavy Fighters (HF) or Tactical Bombers (TAC)
at detecting and sinking submarines. I will use Commonwealth models in this document, but
other nations have similar ships and planes available.


## Summary:
ASW requires the coordinated use of specialized fleets and aircraft on specific missions to be
successful:
1. Fleets of 20 to 40 FF on convoy escort to screen convoys and prevent losses. You can
add CL, heavy cruisers (CA) and escort carriers (CVL) to these fleets to provide some
protection against enemy surface raiders but bear in mind fuel consumption.

2. Fleets of 4 to 5 FF on patrol to detect the submarines.

3. Fleets of 4 DD and 1 CVL on strike force from a nearby naval base to kill detected
submarines.

4. Battle fleets of different sizes on strike force to intervene if enemy surface fleets are
attacking your convoys and convoy defense fleets.

5. Air wings of PA or, if you don’t have them, TAC on naval strike over the threatened sea
zones. They will help detect submarines and will also kill them.

6. Land based radars covering the threatened sea zones. They will help to detect the subs.

While convoy escort fleets protect convoys, all they generally do is reduce losses. This is for a
simple reason, if you look at the submarines in the combat screen you will see that there is an
eye symbol with a line through it over the subs. This means you haven’t detected the subs and
therefore can’t attack them.

## Convoy escort :
When convoys are being attacked by subs, the convoy escort order will bring allied fleets to
defend the convoys. The more ships that have the range to cover the naval zones that you have
on this order, the higher the efficiency. On 100% efficiency, convoy fleets will always be
defended when attacked. Bear in mind if you run our fuel then your ships will not have any
range.

Once battle is engaged with the subs, the fleet will screen the convoys in the same manner as
escort ships screen capital ships from torpedoes. The subs will automatically retreat after firing
one volley of torpedoes. The effectiveness of this order will depend on the number of escort
ships available to screen the convoys. A 3:1 ratio is a minimum as bad weather or terrain
modifiers can reduce the screening efficiency.

The ideal ship to provide convoy defense in sea zones where the enemy has no air cover is a
stripped out Bitern FF with the smallest gun, sonar and depth charges, They have a naval range
of 5500km which will cover most sea zones. With a production cost of 520 they are cheap
enough to produce large quantities of them. Quantity is required to cover a lot of sea zones and
to replace any losses inflicted by enemy surface fleets.

In your naval doctrine, selecting the slots with improved escort efficiency means you will need
fewer of these ships to screen the convoys. However, it will not help to detect or sink the subs.

## Detecting subs:

The screenshot below shows two fleets of 5 x FF on patrol orders with Andrew Cunningham as
their admiral. They have spotted a fleet of 0-6 ships and are in the process of locating them.

If you hover your mouse pointer over the grey bar on the right of the German fleet box a new
information text box will pop up. This tells you how well or badly you are detecting the fleet.
When your progress reaches 100%, the enemy fleet will be located, visible and the patrol fleet
and strike forces will engage them subject to their engagement rules.

As you can see in the picture below, a lot of factors come in to play for detection which
accumulates every hour:

1. UK surface detection is compared to the GER surface visibility and vice versa. Fitting
radars to your patrolling FF is useful because it massively increases your surface
detection. FF also have a smaller surface visibility factor than DD or CL which reduces
GER surface detection %. This is why you only want to patrol with FF only, other ships
are too big and easily detected by the subs.

2. UK sub detection is compared to GER sub visibility. This is where your sonar and
doctrine add a lot of factors.Ship radars also add sub detection.

3. The patrolling fleet speed is compared to the GER sub speed. Faster FF means a bonus
for sub detection so fit the largest engine to your patrolling FF and strip out unnecessary
weapons that reduce speed.

4. Coordination is a bonus given by land-based radars

### The base detection is also affected by:

1. 1% minimum factor. Basically a random chance of stumbling on a sub.

2. The number of ships active in a region. The more there are the more chances of spotting
subs. This is another reason why you want a lot of cheap FF on convoy escort.

3. Having intel networks in German coastal areas and naval department gives you
bonuses. In this example, UK has no naval department and GER has it. Neither have
networks in each other’s countries and they haven’t decrypted each other’s codes.

4. Air superiority in this example is given by 74 PA (Beaufort mk1) on naval strike in the
region. Also note that PA have a small sud detection factor which helps.

5. Land based radars clearly have a major influence which is why you should build them
near threatened sea zones before the war starts. You should also close sea zones to
traffic to route convoys along sea zones where you have radars.

6. The last factor is the weather which will reduce ASW detection chances.

Once the subs are detected, battle is engaged. As you can see on the picture below, the 5 UK
FF are in the fight but a French AI fleet on patrol orders has also joined the fun.

Unfortunately, this means our positioning is now 0% as there are too many ships in the fight
and this massively reduces our attack. This demonstrates why you should not have large
patrolling fleets or too many of them. It is also why you want FF with enough depth charges to
sink submarines before other fleets show up and reduce your positioning to nil.

Fortunately, our patrol aircraft showed up and saved the day sinking one sub. Also note French
AI fleets on Strike Force orders are now on their way to the battle.

The battle ended with the second sub being sunk by the French DD Annamite.

This example is atypical as neither side has doctrine researched and the Germans are using
early subs. However, it demonstrates nicely how ASW is a combined operation involving the use
of specialized fleets, radars and patrol aircraft to detect then sink submarines. It requires careful
advance planning to research, particularly radar, and build all the units required before the war.
Improvising ASW in 1940-41 will lead to catastrophic and historical loss of convoys.

## What about other ships?

1. You will need fleets of light and heavy cruisers backed up with an aircraft carrier on strike
force to back up your patrolling and convoy escort fleets. If enemy surface fleets attack
your FF, these strike forces will intervene and hopefully sink or head off the enemy fleet.

2. Your convoy escort fleets can have cruisers and CVL included in them as it will help
deter the enemy from using small surface fleets to attack them.

3. Once a sub fleet is detected it is visible for a number of hours. If you have a small fleet of
fast 4 x DD and 1 x CVL on strike force orders, they will arrive in time for the the CVL’s
naval bombers to sink the subs. You can also use these for patrolling but their high
surface visibility makes them less effective.
