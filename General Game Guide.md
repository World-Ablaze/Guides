# Basics
## Changes to the Economy:
Economy Fatigue is a new system to World Ablaze, it represents inflation, large government spending and
a shrinking civilian economy. 
Economic, manpower and trade laws now gradually provide economy fatigue which reduces construction speed and eventually stability and factory output. They also now give a weekly penalty to war support, to combat this there are more decisions and ministries you can invest in. 


The best strategy is to make your wars quick and demobilize after a war.It is natural to have Economic fatigue when militarizing your economy
and it should not be something you should try and keep at 0% The following are the main ways of decreasing economic fatigue:

Focuses, War bonds, Decisions (most are available only when at war)Lowering your laws (only as a last resort if
close to 100% fatigue). Staying on partial mob will cause your fatigue to go from 0% to 100% in 24 years, War
economy is 12 and total mobilization is 6. Be aware that focuses can also increase fatigue.

## Changes to Industry:

Military and civilian factories have had their output halved but in return you get double the amount of
said factories (For most nations). Naval dockyards and military factories require coal while civilian factories
require 1 steel.

To accompany this, the max civilian construction count is 20 for each new building. 

New resources have also been added, which include bauxite, coal and iron. 3 new buildings accompany these resources. 
Aluminium Smelter uses Bauxite and Coal to make Aluminium. 

Hydro-Powered Aluminium Smelter uses Bauxite to produce Aluminium but is more expensive than the Aluminium Smelter. 
Steel Mill Uses Iron and Coal to produce Steel.

Infrastructure also no longer boosts the amount of steel and aluminium you get from a state as they only come
from these factories.

## Changes to the Tech Trees:
Each major nation has unique tank, air, navy and artillery Tech Tree's that all have there historical stats for
their equipment. Minor nations who have the generic air and artillery tree have worse stats than the Major's Min
or nations also do not start with a generic tank tree anymore and rely on major nations for tanks via decisions.

Certain tanks have multiple variations in the tech tree such as the Panzer IV. Switching production between these variants will result in very little loss in efficiency. Ships unlock with their historical modules already attached leaving little to be refitted and researched. 

They have also been split into historical archetypes. 
The new additions specialize in the following, frigates are very effective against submarines, heavy cruisers are effective
against light ships and light carriers are cheaper versions of carriers.

## Changes to Politics:
The Ministries Section has been added to the Political Tab. The new additions include:
Ministry of Culture which is focused around women’s place in society. It starts off with more home
orientated roles that give you higher population gain, but you can change it at a significant cost or through focuses
to provide more bonuses to your industry and army. For example, higher recruitable population and/or factory
output.

Ministry of Defence is focused on war bonds. You use these to reduce your economic fatigue. However,
these can only be accessed during war situations and come at the cost of consumer goods for 2 years.
Ministry of Propaganda is focused on providing war support. Since high tier economy laws take weekly
war support, this is used to counter that. Each level provides 0.1% weekly war support and takes 0.05 political
power per day.

Ministry of Labour is focused on providing miscellaneous buffs such as stability for some consumer goods
or a small recruitable population boost for some PP.

Ministry of Business is essentially your economic ideology and it is heavily tied to your political ideology.
Fascists can’t fully privatise for example and democracies can’t follow the ideas of national socialism. Each
economic ideology provide different buffs and debuffs that range from stability increases/decreases, consumer
goods increases/decreases, construction speed, research time, ideology drift defence and so on..

## Changes to Combat:
Combat width has been changed from 100 to 90 making the ideal division have 30 combat width. Weather and
terrain are much harsher. Organization takes longer to regain and is dependent on infrastructure and Supply lasts
10 days instead of 3 days. New units have been added and the descriptions for the unique ones can be found
below.

Armoured Cars, they are split between combat and scout. Combat cars generally have a equal armament
to light tanks but are cheaper and less durable. Scout cars provide org and can be used as recon. They are also
wheeled which gives them different terrain modifiers.

Assault Tanks, They have much more armor and soft attack than SPG's but have less breakthrough and
defence. They also serve on the front lines making them alot more vulnerable than SPG's. As a result of their extra
armor they cost more too.

Heavy Units, Currently field guns and infantry have heavy variants. These are much better units than their
normal counterparts but cost more, are slower and take more supply.

Misc, There is a hard cap of 12 Carriers per battle. Deathstacks have been heavily nerfed so that the ideal fleet size
is now 50. The Number of screen ships required per capital is now 4 instead of 3. There are amphibious
mechanized units for better naval invasion performance. Light tanks can also be used for recon

# France

## Tech Tree:

## Infantry:
French Light equipment is one of the cheapest to produce but lacks Submachine guns early on, upgrading
equipment is difficult and France is heavily reliant on heavy machine guns to have strong defensive. France has
access to WWI equipment as world tension rises, thus producing modern equipment as soon as possible is
recommended.

## Armour:
French tanks are quite splintered at the beginning and lack even an average amount of tank variants. It is
recommended to focus on heavy tanks as they offer great armour and have alright stats. The Hotchkiss light tanks
can be used to exploit breakthroughs and also have great armour for light tanks.
As time goes on however medium and modern tanks become more and more competitive and should become a
essential part of the French army.

## Artillery:
France is heavily reliant on heavy variants to provide competitive stats and should try and produce regular
artillery at a high quantity to ensure sufficient soft attack. Anti tank guns should be used in every frontline
infantry unit due to the static nature of early French warfare. Any large breakthrough of tanks can prove
disastrous for the French army

## Land Doctrine:
Massed Artillery, Integrated Support, Equal spacing, zeroing artillery, air killzones, stationary battery,
Constant Barrage, Fire by command
Frontal Tanks, Schwerpunkt, Long Range Combat, War of Supremacy
Decisive Strategy, Defence in Depth, Grand Battleplan, Orders by Directive, Overlapping Defensive
Positions, Skirmish Lines, Mortar Pits

## Navy:
The French navy is pretty average among all majors, neither excelling in one place nor falling behind in
one area. Its is recommended to use a mix of all units in your fleets and prioritize creating a modern navy with a
fully stacked strike force and patrol units otherwise you risk being spread too thin.

## Aircraft:
The French air force stays on par with other major nations but doesn’t excel in any particular area.
Investment will lead to a French army that can sustain offensives and protect from bombers adequately,
otherwise you will have to take a very defensive mentality and invest in AA

## Focus Tree:
An immediate decision needs to be made when approaching the focuses, and that is whether to fully
commit or hold off to gain more political power. Fully committing is the historical option and lets France gain a
very well developed industry able to equip its large army and attempt to invest in the air force and tanks. Holding
off however allows France to fix its internal problems and remove Disjointed government which removes a lot of
debuffs and replaces them with good National Spirits

## Some key focuses are:
Encourage Immigration, National Champions, Plan V and Division cuirassee

## Politics and Construction:
Silent workhorse should be the first person you pick using pp, from there again decisions need to be made
whether you want to get Leon Blum to try and reform the government or attempt to get some high command.
Building in Southern France is the safest location for French industry. Building civs until you get early mob and
then switching to mils is recommended

## Negative National Spirits:
Full Employment - Removed after encouraging immigration
Disjointed Government - Removed by completing Unify the Government
General Tips:
Create motorized divisions and use the Dyle-Breda line to secure Belgium and ensure the help of British
ground forces in Belgium
Build an airforce to contest German air superiority
Use 4 divisions per tile, keep the line as static as possible until the military is reformed

# Italy

## Infantry:
Italian Light and heavy equipment is very upgradable and should be kept as modern as possible to remain
competitive. Excellent mortar upgrades make the Italian quite deadly if you manage to make full infantry divisions

## Armour:
Italian armour can be best described as a year behind, however they are essential to achieve grand Italian
plans and should not be ignored especially if the Italians stand alone. Making use of the cheap equipment and
tank variants help compensate for Italy’s weaknesses. It is recommended to use focuses to try and rush tanks as
Italy if you are planning an armour build.
If a tank core is established early on, upgrading to Italian panther tanks (if aligned with Germany) or using heavy
tanks can propel Italy as an equal on the tank battlefield

## Artillery:
Italy has strong artillery at the start of the game with decent AA and AT for the start of the game. Fighting
infantry and mechanized is doable however early enemy armour could prove difficult to challenge, hence the
usage of heavy AA in some divisions could help contain armour thrusts

## Land Doctrine:
Massed Artillery, Integrated Support, Equal spacing, zeroing artillery, Frontal Support, stationary battery,
Constant Barrage, Fire by request
Frontal Tanks, Armoured Waves, Long Range Combat, War of Supremacy
Advanced Squad tactics, Defence in Depth, Grand Battleplan, Orders by Directive, Overlapping Defensive
Positions, Skirmish Lines, Mortar Pits

## Navy:
The Italian navy is the strongest branch of the Italian military, at the start of the game it is in the process
of becoming a real threat to any major nation. Proper investment into more screens, capital ships and submarines
will ensure safe naval zones for the axis in the med. Italian carriers struggle to keep up with other majors however
in raw stats, nonetheless having them can still prove extremely valuable. Submarines is also an area that Italy
does well, a mix of both types of subs can help greatly in disrupting allied supply and even help Germany in the
battle of the Atlantic.

## Aircraft:
Italy’s aircraft Is a mixed bad, containing some good designs while falling short on others. Unfortunately
for Italy this results in very varying performance. Early CAS and bomber designs are worth building but have poor
upgrades in the late stage of the war, the opposite is true for Italian fighters, multiroles and naval bombers.

## Focus Tree:
Italy starts off with a small industry and an outdated army. Focuses are a great step towards reforming
this, however the biggest enemy for Italy is time. Focusing on the industry focuses first will enable you to build
enough divisions to guard your coast and diversify your army, while focusing on military focuses will help a great
way towards getting a modern yet small military. Of course there is always the choice of balancing between the
two but whichever route you pick it is key that you finish the war with Ethiopia as soon as possible in order to do
the Military Modernization Focus and then rush towards sending Spanish volunteers
Some key focuses are:
Prospect for Oil, Align with German Politics, Military Modernization, The Corpo Truppe Volontarie and
realization of modern warfare

## Politics and Construction:
As Italy, a focus on rapid military growth should be your priority. The Italian high command provides the
smallest amount of buffs so getting better equipment in your divisions would be more useful. Due that it is
recommended you get an infantry, navy, air and armour designer in that order along with mandatory army
service.

While at war with Ethiopia, building a few fuel silos will help you train your military during the pre war period and
once military modernization is done a full military and dockyard construction should begin. Fitting a few hydro
steel mills and synthetic refineries before the war starts will help Italy greatly.
Negative National Spirits:
Inadequate Military – Split into 3, Removed after 4 modernization efforts in each area using XP
Grand Council of Fascism – Not necessarily a bad NS but it can cause a civil war if invaded and you haven’t
finished dictator of Italy
General Tips:
Have garrison forces at the start of the war to prevent early invasions
Either invade or bomb Malta and use that naval zone to supply troops in Africa
Split infantry division templates in 2 with one having the base template and the other modern to ensure
some military modernization in important fronts

## Infantry:
Japanese infantry equipment falls slightly behind the big 4 nations but is still adequate for invasions and
garrisons and more than enough to fight China. Make sure early heavy infantry bonuses are researched before the
war with China begins. Due to the lack of enemy armour Japan will face, it is better to not upgrade 1936 heavy
equipment until 1941

## Armour:
Japan has a few standout tanks such as there assault line, while Japan is not expected to face significant
enemy armour, building atleast 3 tank divisions will give your military a great amount of flexibility when it comes
to the war with the allies. Make use of your many research slots and plenty of army xp from China to carefully
construct a tank division that will enable you to punch through any stubborn lines the allies set up and really take
the Pacific by storm.

Light tanks can also provide a significant advantage over Chinese divisions which will help in capitulation
or the taking of large ground at a much smaller risk to your own casualties.

## Artillery:
Japanese artillery have large leaps in their upgrades to keep up with other majors. Not neglecting artillery
upgrades therefore is important. Japanese AT and AA however are poor and so an investment in their heavy
variants could be an avenue to make up for that.

## Land Doctrine:
Massed Artillery, Integrated Support, Equal spacing, zeroing artillery, air killzones, stationary battery,
Harassment Fire, Fire by command
Frontal Tanks, Schwerpunkt, Battlefield Brawler, War of Movement
Large front Operations, Defence in Depth, Shock and Awe, Orders by Task, Fortified Fighting Positions,
Blob Formations, Pocket defence

## Navy:
Your navy is your sword and shield against Britain and the US and will make or break your campaign. Your
battleships and battlecruisers have excellent heavy attack all around and some of them have excellent armour as
well. Your heavy cruisers start off reasonably good and can be retrofitted to become very good, with firepower,
armour, and torpedoes. Your carriers can carry just as many planes as the American ones, though their AA is
significantly weaker.

Your destroyers however struggle in surface combat but are the best torpedo destroyers in the game. The biggest
downside to the navy is a severe lack of ASW. Refitting older ships is crucial as Japan is plagued with a lack of
dockyards to create new ships and so it is unlikely you will have a taskforce full of new ships.

## Aircraft:
The Japanese Air Force has quite a few good options, particularly when it comes to carrier ships. Sadly,
your limited industrial base means you’ll want to focus on a handful of types in order to have reasonable numbers
of airwings. It is recommended to focus on land CAS early on before adopting carrier CAS as well as carrier
fighters and naval bombers. Tactical bombers and patrol planes are also necessary to reach the vast spaces you
will be fighting in and counter submarines

## Focus Tree:
Japan has plenty of good choices to choose from there focus tree. It is recommended to rush Spiritual
mobalization early on the keep the army growing but keep an eye on the interservice rivalry that will occur when
doing some military focuses. It is recommended to at least start on every Japanese puppet focus but other than
that any route you take is a viable strategy
Some key focuses are:
Supremacy of will, Set up the Wang Jingwei Regime, Exploit China, National defence state

## Politics and Construction:
Two big keys for Japan are planning ahead and prioritizing. It is highly recommended you build up to 10
fuel silos at the start of the game and keep that stockpile as full as possible before the war starts. Japanese
industry is the second smallest out of the major 7 nations, but you will find enough capacity to build a large and
diverse military. Don’t neglect the colonial/protectorate trees for Manchuria, Korea, Mengjiang, and eventually
China as well. Not only do they give you PP, but they also give you more factories that you desperately need (even
the Manchurian ones, vassal industry applies to you as well).

There is the issue of how unbalanced the Home Islands are in development. Five regions- Kyushu,
Chugoku, Kansai, Tokai, and Kanto- have good/decent infrastructure at game start and will very quickly fill almost
completely up with factories by 1940, both through focuses and through your own construction, while the other
five regions- Shikoku, Koshinetsu, Hokuriku, Tohoku, and Hokkaido- have little infrastructure and industry. It can’t
be helped, and a factory is a factory, but it’s recommended that you build up the infrastructure on Shikoku,
Koshinetsu, and Hokkaido (these regions have natural resources that you’re simultaneously increasing production
in), a little at a time, to help with putting factories in those areas as well. Take the time to build lots (9-10 more
than you start with by 1942) of steel mills and a few aluminium smelters as well- you WILL need the extra
resources.

## Negative National Spirits:
Gekokujo - Removed after appointing Tojo’s Cabinet
Duplicae Air research - Removed by completing The Imperial Japanese Airforce
Traditional Architecture – Unable to be removed

## General Tips:
Have strong garrison forces at the start of the war with the allies to prevent early invasions
Keep the Invasions going in the allies, your biggest chance of winning in the pacific will be in the first 6
months.

Do not capitulate China, take there major cities besides chongking, use them to grind xp, exploit there
land and take war bonds. This will maximise your number of land doctrines and enable you to go on total
mobilization very early on.

# Germany

## Infantry:
German light equipment should be upgraded as often as possible, the split with the Gewehr and the Stg 44
comes down to stats vs production cost and it is up to you to decided which one is better or if you want both.
German heavy machine guns mostly become cheaper as time goes one and is one of the best in the game, it is
recommended to ensure all infantry in your army is regular and not light, however if you find yor lacking in heavy
equipment, skip the 1939 MG 34+Panzerbuchse 38.

## Armour:
German tanks initially lack armour and piercing but have excellent speed, breakthrough and defence
allowing them to overcome most enemy tanks. Early on all types of German tanks play a role on the battlefield
and it is recommended to pursue all tank types. Mechanized is split into 2 where the choice comes down to speed
vs HP.

German late war tanks catch up and surpass the average armour and firepower. They retain high mobility as well
making them fearsome opponents if it was not for their high production cost, generally poor reliability and high
fuel consumption. Fuel is a massive issue for Germany regardless however and so you have to pursue a policy of
quality over quantity, therefore investing in heavy and modern tanks will keep the possibility of Victory alive.

## Artillery:
Germany will find itself in many theatres of combat and most often will face overwhelming airpower. It is
thus advised to pursue all artillery lines. A very special artillery piece is the 8.8cm Flak which provides very good
early piercing for German divisions if you begin to struggle with heavy armour in France and the UK.

## Land Doctrine:
Advanced Firebases, Dispersed Support, Concentrated spacing, zeroing artillery, frontal support (if making
use of heavy anti air), mobile Artillery, Harassment Fire, Fire by request
Combined Warfare, Schwerpunkt, Long Range Combat, War of Movement
Advanced Squad Tactics, Elastic Defence, Shock and Awe, Orders by Task, Fortified Fighting Positions,
Skirmish Lines, Mortar Pits

## Navy:
The Kriegsmarine has some pretty heavy hitters among their surface fleet, however due to there small size
it is recommended to persue a policy of trade interdiction. This either results in investment in Capital ships or
submarines or both. German destroyers have some of the highest HP and their light cruisers make excellent
screens for surface raiders.
German subs also are quite effective and have good range and stealth. It is highly recommended to invest in both
types of ships to make sure no enemy can hard counter you in the sea. Stay away from enemy airbases is key to
keep your fleet raiding convoys for as long as possible

## Aircraft:
The Luftwaffe have a diverse amount of aircraft sporting good agility, excellent ground strike and air
attack stats. Due to being outnumbered it is recommended to convert old models of planes to newer ones as
much as possible to not only have an edge in combat, but to also keep losses low to maximise the amount of
airpower you can project. Investing early in jets is key to retain supremacy in the sky. Use attackers and/or heavy
fighters to fend off enemy bombers and accomplish objectives.
A key strength of Germany s there multiroles and tactical bombers which can do a variety of tasks at decent
effectiveness with no obvious weakness besides being outnumbered.

## Focus Tree:
Economy Fatigue dictate how you want to go about the focus tree. There are a lot of focuses and many
take a short time to complete, but it can still be a struggle on what to pick before going to war. If you want the
edge in rubber and fuel, rush I.G. Farben and build a lot of synths using it. It is highly recommended you
accompany this with fuel silos and stockpile a minimum of 3 million fuel.
A strong industry can lead to a quicker victory and so it may be prudent to bite the bullet and pick the focuses that
give you the most factories. As long as you don’t reach 100% economy fatigue during war, it will be worth it.
It is essential to invest in your army as Germany can easily get the edge in doctrines over any country it fights
early on and even during the invasion of the Soviet Union. It is also essential to invest in some naval focuses to
complete the naval doctrine and have an effective Kriegsmarine throughout the war.

## Some key focuses are:
Coal Liquidization, Plan the Third Generation, Aeronautic Funding, Atlantik Wall, Modular construction,
Appoint Albert Speer (available after feb 1942), Secure Swedish iron and Flak towers.

## Politics and Construction:
As Germany you should focus on rearming your country as fast as possible, focus on building military
buildings. Germany has many buffs for these types of buildings and debuffs to civilian buildings due to economy
fatigue and other factors. Thus ignore building civilian factories completely
Going with Rhineland and then proclaiming the axis powers can give plenty of political power to pick both of your
silent workhorses and revel in an abundance of pp to spend. After that it is advisable to get mandatory army
service and an army theorist to help grow and modernise the German army.
Negative National Spirits:
Economic Divide - Removed after going down either economic focus trees
Relaxed Industry - Removed by completing Appoint Albert Speer
General Tips:
Ensure an atlantik wall is present before you fight the Soviets
Quality and strategy will win the war for Germany, ensure you adapt to new situations and always persue
the best technology, falling behind in any sector can easily bring doom.

Germany’s best advantage early on is its advancements in doctrine, make sure you do not leave any wars
too late otherwise you will lose this edge
Make use of Reichskommissariats, they may seem quite the sink but pay off really well in the long run

# Soviet Union

## Infantry:
Soviet light equipment is very cheap early on and you should always be producing it through 1942 with
the aim of always keeping a large stockpile, therefore it is recommended you always have 2 lines of production
with one being the Mosin Nagant and the other being of your choosing to equip your elite divisions. Early Soviet
heavy equipment however is expensive and has bad stats and there it should be upgraded but always after
researching the most recent industry techs.
Soviet equipment have average stats but excel in breakthrough. However this can only really be made use of after
reforms are complete.
Armour:

Soviet Tanks on paper look great, good armour and good firepower. However many lack the ergonomics of
other nations aswell as radios and good vision. Therefore they frequently run into high casualties due to very poor
breakthrough and defence. It is advisable to keep them from frontline action until they are absolutely needed,
atleast early on.

Keep upgrading your models as eventually they will fix many of their problems, pair them up with tank destroyers
and assault guns to overcome there shortfalls and the Soviet tanks can become one of the most fearsome ground
armies in the world. The one consistently shining grace of the Soviet tanks are there cheap cost and excellent
armour and have the most armoured tank in the game, the IS-7.
Another distinct lack Soviet armour has however is SPAA which has to be compensated for by having a strong
airforce.

## Artillery:
Soviet Artillery has good stats and should be used to help counter their poor military performance against
major nations. The Soviets specialize in rocket artillery which provide excellent breakthrough stats that can
seriously buff the performance of elite infantry or tank divisions. Otherwise it is key to produce anti tank weapons
and equip your whole army with them as well as AA. They have decent stats and ensure your chances of a total
frontal collapse is not high.

## Land Doctrine:
Massed Artillery, Dispersed Support, Concentrated Spacing, Zeroing Artillery, Air Killzones, Stationary
Battery, Constant Barrage, Fire by Request
Combined Warfare, Deep Operations, Battlefield Brawler, War of Annihilation
Large Front Operations, Defense in Depth, Shock and Awe, Orders by Directive, Overlapping Defensive
Positions, Skirmish Lines, Pocket Defence

## Navy:
The Red Navy is very outdated and small, In order to overcome these shortcomings the Soviets have very
firepower heavy ships that do not cost as much as other nations. However ship upgrades are few and far between
and unless they outnumber an enemy they will almost always come out worse. Build a few BBs to complete the
greatest navy mission and equip as many subs for minewarfare
Use these ships for shore bombardment, closing off straits and protecting you against invasions.

## Aircraft:
The Red air force is heavily dependant on there single engine aircraft to perform the bulk of their air
missions and it is reflected in the stats of other types of aircraft. Strike and Tactical bombers aswell as attackers
can be useful when airfields are getting bombed but it is always recommended to go down the cas and fighter
line. Soviet fighters sport good agility but are amongst the poorest air attack. The Cas have some of the toughest
air defence and have high ground attack.
Your ground forces are very dependant on airpower to not suffer huge losses due to a lack of SPAA and so always
keep your air lines at the start of the gam because if quality wont cut it, quantity will.

## Focus Tree:
The Soviet Focus tree is all about expansion and industrialization. 5 year plans help greatly depending on
which one is active. The 2nd fiver year plan focuses on civilian industry, the 3 rd five year plan focuses on military
industry and the 4th fiver year plan focuses on reconstruction and repair.
There is no real right way to progress through the focus tree however it is recommended to do the great purge
after the 2nd five year plan as it is only available when conducting no five year plan, and prioritize industry over
military. The size of your army is your greatest shield. Ensure the winter war is done as soon as Poland falls so you
can rush Stavka and begin your military reforms.

## Some key focuses are:
Urbanize the urals, Lessons of war, form the Stavka, utilization of Tulan arms industry, planned economy,
emergency powers

## Politics and Construction:
Many of the Soviet expansions are dealt through decisions rather than war justification. The SU lacks pp
gain early on and must be used wisely. A good early aim is to get partial mobilization in 37 gain the popular
figurehead. Always recruit reserve divisions, and remember to complete your faction missions to fill out your high
command. It is highly recommended to pick a military advisor asap and send attaches to spain and china to gain
xp and steal gold reserves.
Keep as much construction project in the urals and improve the infrastructure in that area. Building airfields and
radar is also recommended along the line between Stalingrad and Moscow

## General Tips:
Do not leave your entire army on the frontline, keep multiple fall back lines around defensible river lines.
Force attack your light tank divisions and discard them after 1941.
Have your good armour ready along side your fallback lines to prevent Germany from exploiting
breakthroughs in your frontline.
The Caucasus are more valuable than Moscow
Use your first land doctrine bonus to switch from mass assault
Do not start the 4th five year plan until after the war

# United Kingdom

## Infantry:
British Light and heavy infantry equipment is good and reliable but not spectacular in any way. Very few
changes in production lead to a very high efficiency throughout the game. Special Forces tech is highly
recommended as Britain gets great bonuses for them in both here focus tree and high command

## Armour:
British tanks have amongst the highest armour or speed during the early and mid game. A high reliance on
both of these will lead to your opponent to develop specific and expensive equipment to counter them. Generally
as Britain you will lack firepower and useful subunits, equipping your medium tanks with heavy artillery and your
heavy tanks with Bishop’s mitigates this.

Rely on support tanks to make up the numbers and be constantly improving your doctrines. Building mechanized
divisions is the most effective thing you can do as the British mechanized is the cheapest amongst any nation

## Artillery:
British Artillery can be best described as good enough to get the job done. Their Anti tank guns are quite
good however, early anti air adoption can be great to counter air superiority from the Germans. The only notable
equipment to avoid is the starting 2 heavy artillery.

## Land Doctrine:
Massed Artillery, Integrated Support, Concentrated spacing, Creeping Barrage, Air Killzones, mobile
Artillery, Harassment Fire, Fire by command
Frontal Tanks, Encirclement, Battlefield Brawler, War of Supremacy
Advanced Squad Tactics, Defence in Depth, Shock and Awe, Orders by Task, Fortified fighting Positions,
Blob formations, Pocket defence

## Navy:
The royal navy has some of the best light cruisers and excellent capital ship models, however due to the
London naval treaty your next BBs and CVs are severely restricted in armament and size. Nonetheless they are
only options at the time and should still be built.
It is important to refit your ships even the ones you will be building up to the lead up to the war and make an
effort to keep up with your frigates research, they are your best defence against enemy subs starting with the
Hunt class.

## Aircraft:
The British air tree offers very competitive planes, it is recommended to go down both the fighter and
multirole lines, and build naval bombers and patrol planes. The spitfires are a great superiority plane, the
multiroles give CAS and have the ability to fight other planes aswell. Once you have your footing and are reaching
200 military factories, you can start building bombers and escorts. British bombers have some of the best strat
bombing stats.

## Focus Tree:
The British focus tree is a mix of rearmament and fortifications. It is important to first focus on addressing
the great depression and developing the commonwealth. Begin rearming as soon as possible and do your
fortification decisions in-between. For your fortifications it is recommended to focus on the Mediterranean first
and as for rearming, aim for the Royal tank corps, chief of staff committee and Royal Ordinance factories.
Britain also gets really nice fatigue reduction decisions from the Sterling reserves and so it is recommended to go
to total mobilization as soon as your war support allows it, the Home defence tree also offers good bonuses which
you will need to mobilize faster

## Some key focuses are:
The Empires Sterling Reserves, Chiefs of Staff committee, British Commonwealth Air training Plan,
Military Training Act, Woman’s land army
Politics and Construction:
An early choice for Britain is to rush there silent workhorse, work on getting your theorists and then fill
out your designers in 1938 before focusing on your high command
Negative National Spirits:
The War to End all wars - Removed after the Military Training Act

## General Tips:
As the UK you should aim for mechanizing your army
Never underestimate the possibility of Sealion, even from the AI. Therefore leave a garrison and naval
force around the UK at all times with dedicated mining ships
Ensure Gibralter and the African coast are well guarded
Make sue you always invest in frigates and Light carriers to
It is recommended to use the matilda tank as its armour is unbeatable early on

# United States of America

## Infantry:
The USA enjoys a very strong infantry tree with the best light infantry in the game. The real choice you will
face as the USA is whether you want to produce the expensive Tompsons over the grease gun. Building both is a
viable option if you want to use the latter for lend lease and keep the best for your own divisions. Keeping up with
heavy equipment research will allow you to gain the bazooka relatively quickly which will make your infantry a
very dangerous threat early on

## Armour:
American armour is non existent until 1939 hits, this is not that big of an issue however due to the lack of
military factories and no early threat. Once the ball gets rolling the USA can pretty much build whatever it likes, a
strong focus on Shermans and mechanized infantry is highly recommended as such. The Sherman tanks however
do require the support of its variants, there is the choice of building early designs of the Pershings instead, but
they suffer from poorer reliability and higher cost while not offering a complete improvement in other stats.
A focus on amphibious mechanized is also recommended for the pacific campaign, there use will give you
a clear advantage over the Japanese. American heavy tanks also offer very good stats if you desire to peruse them
but they still require variants of the Sherman to be well rounded against all threats.

## Artillery:
American artillery combined with there doctrine is a formidable force. However the early guns lack very
good stats besides regular AA, with the really good equipment coming in 1941+. As the USA you can rely on heavy
variants much more than other countries

## Land Doctrine:
Advanced Firebases, Integrated Support, Concentrated spacing, Creeping Barrage, Air Killzones, mobile
Artillery, Harassment Fire, Fire by command
Combined Warfare, Encirclement, Long Range Warefare, War of Supremacy
Advanced Squad Tactics, Defence in Depth, Shock and Awe, Orders by Task, Fortified fighting Positions,
Blob formations, Pocket defence

## Navy:
The American navy heavily relies on there capital ships to win naval dominance, not only do they start
with a lot of them but they have the ability to build many more. It is recommended to follow the base strike
doctrine and refit your ships

## Aircraft:
The United States airforce starts of rough but becomes the most powerful airforce near the end of ww2.
Ofcourse the key strength is the ability to build a massive fleet of bombers, something less obvious is there
excellent multiroles/CAS and heavy fighters/attackers which offer the best CAS and good escort potential.
Building patrol planes could be useful to hunt submarines and tactical bombers offer good flexibility in the pacific.
America’s 2 bomber lines each specialize in the pacific and in Europe respectively.

## Focus Tree:
The USA’s focus tree is fairly straight forward. Most of your choices revolve around your factions and
picking whom you side with. A fairly important choice however is whether to do judicial reforms or not. Doing
them is ahistorical but opens many long term benefits for the USA while the other path gives nice short term
bonuses.

It is important to go down the focus on asia and Europe focuses in order to project your power and embargo
countries, bringing the whole of south America along with you. Giant wakes must be done as soon as possible to
begin fixing the great depression and putting the USA on the road to building a military

## Some key focuses are:
Budget Balancing, cash and carry act, Hatch Act, Focus on Asia, Fund the navy, Build the pentagon,
Manhattan Project

## Politics and Construction:
Silent workhorse is a must go to advisor for the USA, Henry Morganthau should be your next choice and
then the industrial concern. After that focus on designers and lastly the high command. building a few dozen
aluminium smelters and synthetic refineries aswell as infrastructure in resource heavy areas is recommended
early on before going full military factories and dockyards once your off civilian economy.

## Negative National Spirits:
The great depression - Removed slowly after doing the Giant Wakes
Neutrality Act – Removed slowly by going through the cash and carry and lend lease act
Political corruption – Removed after doing the Hatch Act
Segregated Army Divisions – Removed after the full desegregation focus

## General Tips:
When at war the USA will be hit by a torpedo crisis that will last in total for 2 years. It is recommended to
be defensive during this time especially when Japan has tora tora tora
Leave plenty of equipment for lend lease, especially for the Soviet Union
Do the send aid decisions as they greatly help your allies contain Germany while your strength is still
growing

Focus on full mechanization, you can afford it
