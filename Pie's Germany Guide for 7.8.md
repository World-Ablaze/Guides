# General Focus Order

This focus order will last you until the start of war, and is a good starting point, deviations after
war don’t really matter much as long as you have your core focuses done

Green focuses should be followed in that order

Danzig or war is pretty obviously done when you want to go to war
Doctrines/etc can be done in any order so its not listed, pick and choose which ones you want at
that time

Naval tree is up to you if you want to go heavier into the navy, I’d recommend new players to
stay away from naval germany though due to the industry cost of buying so much iron.

**All focuses listed in red should be done ASAP**

# Industry

Build 1 infra in Westfalen and 1 in Niedersachsen
Build 1 steel mill in both of the rhineland states

Then go to straight building mils until you hit 230 (pre-sudetenland)
Then go to building refineries (25 total,build as many as you can pre danzig or war you likely
won’t be completed until 40) Then go straight building mils

At danzig or war queue up 3 alum mils in series at the top

build 2 silos at a time at the top until you reach a fuel stockpile you want (I aim for 3.5mil)
Rest of industry used to build mils and supply/etc Build level 5 airfields and some radar for barb

NEVER BUILD AA UNTIL 42

NEVER BUILD AIRFIELDS PAST LVL 5 THEY ARE WAY TOO EXPENSIVE
DON'T UPGRADE RAILWAYS BEYOND 10 TILES THEY ARE WAY TOO EXPENSIVE BUILD
A SUPPLY HUB/PORT INSTEAD

ONLY BUY AS MUCH IRON AS YOU NEED STEEL TO SAVE CIVS



<a name="br3"></a>IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING BUILD IN HIGHEST INFRA STATES

1936 Starting Industry:

If you set up these numbers for infantry equipment/etc you likely will never have to touch it ever
again unless you take horrendous losses

15 Light Infantry Equipment
25 Heavy Infantry Equipment
18 Support

12 Artillery (go up to 18 later)
3 AT

5 Trucks (go up to 15 later)
4 Trains (go up to 10 later)
8 do17s

Any mils you build put on the following when you get them

1939 Danzig Target:

15 Light Infantry Equipment 25 Heavy Infantry Equipment 18 Support 18 Artillery

1 Hv Artillery 15 Trucks 10 Trains

75 BF109s (Convert all pre 109e-4 models to it) 30 pz iiis 15 pz ivs 10 mech

5 AT when you get 5cm paks
1 pz 38t 15 ju88s 3 HV AA

1 scout plane

1 transport planes



<a name="br4"></a>1941 Barb Target: ~440 mils 25 Light Infantry Equipment 25 Heavy Infantry Equipment 18 Support 18 Artillery

3 Hv Artillery 15 AT

5 HV AA 25 Trucks 25 Trains

130 FW 190s (Before you swap the bf109 production line you should have converted all of

them to the 109f4 model)
100 pz iiis 15 pz ivs 20mech 1 pz 38t 35 Ju88

1 transport planes
1 scout plane

# Wehrmacht

# Army spirits:

Spirit of academy: Always take theater training no questions asked
Spirit of the Army: State serves the military, by using the extra pp on the repeatable 25xp
decision you actually come out way ahead compared to professional officer corps
Spirit of division command: Operational reserves or flexible organization, logistical focus if you
really need it

# DOCTRINES:

THERE IS PRETTY MUCH ONLY 1 WAY YOU CAN DO DOCTRINE, ALMOST ALL OTHER
OPTIONS ARE WORSE

You want to buy all of the first tier with spain xp before you use the -99% since the later tiers are
more expensive




<a name="br5"></a>Templates




<a name="br6"></a>Danzig Target

6 tank divisions (its okay if they aren’t fully mediums yet)
84 infantry

5 paratroopers (use for crete/malta)

Barb Target

24 tank divisions

140 infantry (only use 108 infantry for barb, rest goes on dday wall
Keep training inf for dday wall

HOW TO USE GENERALS

Because I keep seeing ppl use the the worst generals and lose
like 15% stats

ALWAYS PROMOTE MANSTEIN AS YOUR INFANTRY FIELD MARSHAL,
Grind him for organizer in spain, if you roll enough logi skill you can get logi wizard
Get thorough planner, aggressive assaulter, offensive doctrine, infantry expert, artillery expert,
ambusher

(General traits still apply to field marshals even though the game tooltip says it doesn't)

Use any general with infantry leader for infantry, promote infantry expert and artillery expert

Try and not use any other generals for infantry, you lose like 10% stats lol

How to use generals for panzer divisions

Model as field marshal

Agressive assaulter, offensive doctrine, charismatic, adaptable (if you grinded hard enough in
spain), panzer expert, combined arms expert




<a name="br7"></a>The panzer generals should ALL have these traits

Paratroopers,

Only one option, take kurt student, he is the only one with +10% paratrooper attack and defense

Luftwaffe

TRAIN ALL THE OLD BIPLANE FIGHTERS PERMANENTLY FOR XP
You want to RUSH the 109F4 btw, then swap to fw190s after if you don’t think you will kill the
soviets in 1941 or 1942

Germany relies on winning the air war early, if you don’t you are likely already dead

Full green air gives massive debuffs to enemy defense and movement like 30-40% debuffs
And air support adds a massive 30+% attack modifier to your divisions on top of the ground
attack. You can expect uncontested german 1941 cas to contribute ~40-50% of the damage in
a plains battle.

Air doctrines



<a name="br8"></a>Air spirits

Spirit of the Air Force

Pawn of officers first to get cheap air advisor
Industry Liaisons to get cheap messerschmitt designer
The Dueling Obsession until you get the 109F4
Then High intensity Training programs

Spirit of Air force command
Massed Strike

All weather flying during russian winter

Danzig Target: 3000 Fighters

800 Cas or 600 strikes

Barb Target: 7-8k fighters

2\.5k cas or 2k strikes




<a name="br9"></a>Navy

1\. Ignore for now, do what you want lol it doesnt matter for fighting sov

Barbarossa

Ok, if you set up everything right, and you have the right generals, right planning, the airforce
and the fuel for it, you can literally be right clicking t34 divisions with infantry in a marsh tile
during barb lol

TLDR: SPAM AIR
