# Guide to US Tank Design

World Ablaze has finally released the long awaited tank designer. The TD will enable more flexibility when it comes to tank production and I will mainly focus on US tanks from # 1939 to # 1945. However some general information before we get to the tanks.

# General

## Decommission
It is very important that you decommission old tanks the moment you research a new model. Due to issues with HOI4 the game won’t notify you if you're producing an outdated tank. So it can be quite easy to find yourself fighting with subpar tanks especially with Germany. This also means that the production menu can get quite clunky with hundreds of tank designs so use that little green button to not get overwhelmed.

## Conversions
Unlike vanilla World Ablaze hasn't utterly thrashed the conversion mechanic into uselessness. So keep that in mind because converting old models into new one’s would do wonders on saving costs.

## Armor
The bonus a division gets from having an armor value greater than another division's piercing was reduced from %50 to %25. This means that unpierceable armored divisions, while tough, are not overwhelming with the proper investment in the hard attack stats.

# 1939

## Mediums

## M2 Medium Tank
Quite frankly a useless tank with subpar stats and no modification options to make it useful down the line. However I do recommend this tank be under research before you do the modernized army focus. That way the M3 Lee will get the %50 bonus which will be a much more useful tank

# 1940

## Lights

### M3 Stuart
Better than the M2 light and more heavily armored than the M2 medium. Very worthwhile to build if you plan on using armored recon. Be aware however that the game won't automatically mark the M2 light as outdated equipment. So make sure to switch over production the moment the research is done.

# 1941

## Lights

### M22 Locust
The low armor makes this tank pretty weak. Do not waste a research slot on it.

## Mediums

### M3 Lee
Finally a true medium tank to build your armored force. Unfortunately the options for modifications are limited. You can switch out the M2 75mm gun to the M3 75mm once you get the sherman. You can then lend lease these upgunned Lee’s to your allies to bolster their tank armies. You will also notice the quite frankly terrible breakthrough stat so you should research the Sherman as soon as you can.

## Tank Destroyers

### T40/M9
The first tank you get with a 76mm gun. Highly recommended to produce these to start up your tank destroyer battalions. Make sure to lend lease them to your allies once the M10 is researched.

# 1942

## Mediums

### T20
A powerful medium but entirely let down by its reliability stats. Not even any future modules will make it useful. But for now this tank should be researched together with the M4A1 Sherman; it will provide two very important modules: the 76mm M1 (M62) and **Ford GAN V8**.

### M4A1
Your main battle tank without the reliability drawbacks. However, if you research this tank together with the T20 you’ll create one hell of a Sherman. Replacing the Continental engine with the **Ford GAN V8** will change its speed from 7.5km to 8.2km, a welcomed mobility advantage.

## Heavy Tanks

### M6
An expensive heavy tank with a short moment of glory. If you're able to afford the 40 ground XP you can boost the armor from 90 to 100. A minor difference but a major benefit during a time where Germany struggled to get long 75 Panzer IV Gs. If so desired you also remove the coaxial 37mm M5 for a small speed advantage and a further reliability boost. Do not recommend however as losing the coax will make it lose out against the Tiger I in soft and hard attack stats. The Gun module may also be exchanged to the 76mm M1 (M62) for a minor stat increase.

## Tank Destroyers

### M10
Your main anti-tank warhorse until # 1944. Switching the continental engine to the **Ford GAN V8** engine from the T20 will boost the speed from 7.8km to 8.5km. I do recommend adding an additional machine guns module to make up for any loss of breakthrough stats.

## Self Propelled Artillery

### M12
If you plan to use SPGs then it is wise to also switch the engine to the **Ford GAN V8**, to avoid holding back your division speed.

# 1943

## Overview
This year is unique to the US tree as this is the time when Germany starts rolling out Panthers and Tiger Is in large numbers. The biggest gun in this era for the US is the 76 but it’s no match against a German modern tank division. So your main goal will be to stack as much hard attack to your tank divisions as possible.

## Assault Tanks

### M4A3E2
A heavily armored sherman that can take on anything short of Panthers and long 88s. But its most important contribution is the Ford GAA V8 Engine. This module will be important when it comes to your mediums. If used remember to refit the gun to the 76mm M1 (M62)

## Mediums

### M4A2
Unfortunately this could be considered a downgrade towards the M4A1. The **Ford GAN V8** wont give it as large of a speed boost as the M4A1 with the only benefit being the armor. However, you could boost the M4A1 armor to be even thicker through the Armor module but beware this is an expensive ground XP investment.

### T23
Unlike the T20 this tank can take full advantage of the designer especially if you take the Jumbo’s Ford GAA V8 Engine. Unlike the GAN the GAA will come with a %5.0 reliability boost which means the mediocre reliability will go from %77.2 to %81.8. This means you can have a 76 armed medium tank before # 1944 and the extra hard attack will be a god send against the Germans. While they may not pierce a German modern tank division they still provide plenty of hard attack to blunt any German armored attack.

## Tank Destroyers

### M18
Unfortunately for the Hellcat it brings nothing to the table besides speed. With the same gun on the M10 without the lack of armor, there really is no reason to research this tank for your  armored divisions. However it’s mobility may give your Mechanized Divisions a new lease in life. By # 1943 the US Mechanized Tank Destroyer starts to grow a long tooth but that’s where the hellcat come’s in. Mounting the Ford GAA V8 Engine the Hellcat’s speed will go from 12.4km to 13.3km. Meaning it won't slow down your Mechanized divisions to give a boost in hard attack and piercing.

# 1944

## Mediums

### M26
Your first modern tank but dreadfully low in modifications until # 1945. Armor of 130 can be upped to 150 for 40 ground XP. However it is better to wait for # 1945 than to spend it.

### M4A3E8
Compared to the T23 when fully modified this tank simply stinks. It’s much slower to the T23 and even less armored. The only advantage it has is the reliability and a very important tank variant needed to research through it, the M36. However this is the tank where you can finally unlock the Sherman 76 turret which will benefit a much older design.

### M4A1
Time to put those large stockpiles of shermans to use. Using the Sherman 76 and 76mm M1 (M62) you can quickly convert your stockpile into heavy hitters. If you have sufficient T23s then you may lend them to allies.

## Tank Destroyers

### M36
A very important Panther killer to compliment your medium tank divisions as your M26 Pershings are in production. Unlike the 17 Pounder the 90mm M3 (M77) doesn’t sacrifice such an obscene amount of soft attack making it better against infantry divisions. However the super star of this tank is the M36 Turret. To get M36 into the field quickly converting your by now monolithic M10 stockpile will be a quick way into pushing them into the field. If needed you can also mount the M36 Turret on the M4A1, M4A2 and M4A3E8.

# 1945

## Mediums

### Super Pershing
Get this tank as soon as possible. Its **90mm T15E1** gun will be your main cannon for mediums that’s superior to everything else. Better than even some of the US post war tanks and the hard attack this gun provides will keep it competitive against German armor. Switch out the turret from **Super Pershing Turret** to the regular **Pershing Turret** as the 200 armor isn’t worth the slow speed. On the plus side it comes with 150 armor without the turret, so you have no need to throw more army XP for armor.

## Tank Destroyers

### M36
The Jackson can fit the **90mm T15E1** gun so make sure to outfit as soon as possible and now you’ll have a cheap tank destroyer with high hard attack and piercing. Make sure to have a production line dedicated to converting short barreled 90mm models.

## Heavy Tanks

### T29
An expensive but well worth it american heavy tank. It can’t pierce King Tiger’s but the **105mm T5E1** has such a high hard attack stat would merely make this tank on par with the German cats.
