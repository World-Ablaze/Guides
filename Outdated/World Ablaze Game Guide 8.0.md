Basics

Changes to the Economy:

Economy Fatigue is a new system to World Ablaze, it represents inflation, large government spending and
a shrinking civilian economy. Economic, manpower and trade laws gradually provide economy fatigue which
reduces construction speed and increases consumer goods, eventually it will also decrease stability, and resource
gain. They also give a weekly penalty to war support. To combat this, there are more decisions and ministries you
can invest in. It is natural to have Economic fatigue when militarizing your economy and it should not be
something you should try and keep at 0% The following are the main ways of decreasing economic fatigue:

- Focuses.
- War bonds (available when at war).
- Decisions (most are available only when at war).
- Lowering your laws (only as a last resort if close to 100% fatigue).

Staying on partial mob will cause your fatigue to go from 0% to 100% in 24 years, War economy takes
approximately 10 years, and total mobilization takes approximately 6 years. Be aware that focuses, closed
economy, and higher conscription laws can also increase fatigue, try and avoid 100% as your nation will collapse.

Changes to Industry:

Military and civilian factories have had their output halved but in return you get double the amount of
said factories (For most nations). Efficiency gain has been severely reduced resulting in a very important choice
between continuing to produce larger quantities of older equipment versus upgrading to the latest model. Naval
dockyards and military factories require coal while civilian factories require 1 steel.

To accompany this, the max civilian construction count is 20 for each new building. New resources have
also been added, which include bauxite, coal and iron. 4 new buildings accompany these resources:

Aluminium Smelter uses Bauxite and Coal to make Aluminium.

Steel Mill Uses Iron and Coal to produce Steel.

Hydro-Powered Aluminium Smelter/Steel Mills which is are more expensive **but don’t use coal**.

Synthetic Refineries consume large quantities of coal for synthetic oil production. Infrastructure also no longer
boosts the amount of steel and aluminium you get from a state as they only come from these factories.

MIOs are unique to each nation, and some provide some pretty great bonuses. Make sure to prioritize the infantry
and artillery production efficiency growth traits.

Train Supply Changes:

Logistics is one of most challenging aspects of warfare. This challenge is almost entirely absent from
Vanilla HOI4 and even most mods. We simulate this most acutely for Germany needed large amounts of trains
during the invasion of the Soviet Union. According to academic sources, Germany had 30% train fulfilment
towards the end of Operation Barbarossa. This means that 70% of German trains had been destroyed or become
inoperable during the first few months of the invasion (this happened for a variety of reasons: normal attrition,
active combat, partisan activity, weather, criminal negligence by German railway organizations, etc.).


The problem is that there is no train attrition in HOI4 like the attrition that exists for supply hub trucks.
The game engine does not support it. The only way you naturally can lose trains is by enemy air logistic strikes.
Thus, to represent the huge lack **of trains Germany was facing, it’s simulated like this in World Ablaze: as you get**
deeper into Soviet territory, you need more and more trains.

If you want 100% train fulfilment by the time you reach Moscow, you must put an ahistorically large
amount of your industry on them, as this is what would have had to be done historically to prevent the eastern
front logistics disaster. You can also take other steps to remediate the situation, such as improving supply usage
within divisions on the front, focusing on logistics points and skills on generals/field marshals, or by pulling troops
off of parts of the front once they are no longer needed. It is intended that fighting under perfect supply deep in
Soviet territory is difficult to achieve, and an average historical run will have supply difficulties at this point.

Changes to the Tech Trees:

Each major nation has unique tank, air, navy and artillery Tech Trees that all have their historical stats for
their equipment. Minor nations who have the generic air and artillery tree have worse stats than the Majors.
Minor nations also do not start with a generic tank tree anymore and rely on major nations for tanks via decisions.
Certain tanks have multiple variations in the tech tree such as the Panzer IV. Switching production between these
variants will result in very little loss in efficiency.

Ships unlock with their historical modules already attached, but you may want to refit older designs to
better fit modern warfare. They have also been split into historical archetypes. The new additions to the following
specialize in the following: frigates are very effective against submarines; heavy cruisers are effective against light
ships and light carriers are cheaper versions of carriers which are best used for anti-submarine warfare. Cruiser
submarines are essentially larger and more expensive versions of normal submarines with more range and are
better suited to certain nations.

Changes to Politics:

```
The Mod has much more in the politics section then vanilla, including:
```
- Ministry of Culture which is focused on **women’s place in society.**
- usually starts off with more home orientated roles that give you higher population gain. These can be
    changed later to provide more bonuses to your industry and army. For example, higher recruitable
    population and/or factory output. This is usually set by focuses, but you can change it for significant
    political power cost.
- Ministry of Propaganda is focused on providing war support. Since high tier economy laws and
    conscription laws take weekly war support, this is used to counter that. Each level provides 0.1% weekly
    war support and takes 0.02 political power per day. Most majors have unique max level propaganda
    organizations.
- Ministry of Labour is focused on providing miscellaneous buffs such as stability for some consumer goods
    or a small recruitable population boost for some PP.
- Ministry of Business is essentially your economic ideology, and it is heavily tied to your political ideology.
    **Fascists can’t fully privatise for example and democracies can’t follow the ideas of national socialism. Each**
    economic ideology provides different buffs and debuffs that range from stability increases/decreases,
    consumer goods increases/decreases, construction speed, research time, ideology drift defence and so on.


Changes to Combat:

Combat width has been changed from 100 to 120 on plains making the ideal division have 30 combat width.
Rough terrain such as Mountains and Jungles use 20 combat width. Weather and terrain are much harsher. As
stated, supply has enormous effects on combat as well. Organization takes longer to regain and is dependent on
infrastructure and Supply lasts 10 days instead of 3 days. New units have been added and the descriptions for the
unique ones can be found below.

- Armoured Cars: split between combat and scout. Combat cars generally have a equal armament to light
    tanks but are cheaper and less durable. Scout cars provide org and can be used as recon. They are also
    wheeled which gives them different terrain modifiers
- Assault Guns: They have much more armour than SPG's but have less breakthrough and defence but
    increased fort and urban attack. They also serve on the front lines making them a lot more vulnerable
    than SPG's. As a result of their extra armour they cost more too.
- Heavy Units, Currently field guns and infantry have heavy variants. These are much better units than their
    normal counterparts but cost more, are slower and take more supply

Misc: There is a hard cap of 10 Carriers per battle. Deathstacks have been heavily nerfed so that the ideal fleet
size is 80. The Number of screen ships required per capital is 4. For ships having 40% more penetration value than
enemy armour means double damage. For tanks you need 25% more penetration than enemy armour to do full
damage, and less than 75% penetration means half damage.

General Template Advice:

While each country may have a unique tech tree, templates can be quite universal. Infantry is usually best
with 9 heavy infantry battalions, 3 artillery, 3 AT, and as many support companies as possible for your economic
situation. Never use light infantry unless in specific wars. Tank divisions vary much more, but most nations have a
template with 8 tank and 6 motorised/mechanized battalions. Special forces templates are mostly nation
dependent, but all have a mix of special forces and other normal battalions depending on their function and
terrain modifiers.

General Doctrine Advice:

Army/Navy/Air Force is one of the most important resources a country can have. Getting doctrines is
usually a huge factor in victory or defeat. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to prioritize
attaches/volunteers/other forms of acquiring experience before you enter a war.

Doctrines are shared across all nations, and all doctrines are split into 3 categories and 3 tiers, with army and navy
doctrines increasing in price as you progress down the tree. There are normally options within each tier, so choose
carefully depending on your nation and war situation.

Some national focuses give doctrine cost reductions, and a good tip is to buy the initial doctrines with
experience before you get these reductions, as the later doctrines are more expensive.


France

Tech Tree:

Infantry:

French Light equipment is one of the cheapest to produce but lacks Submachine guns early on, upgrading
equipment is difficult and France is heavily reliant on heavy machine guns to have strong defensive. France has
access to reserves that come up with 50% equipment and an army that is fully equipped, therefore it is
recommended to only leave a small amount of factories on infantry equipment

Armour:

French tanks are quite splintered at the beginning and lack even an average amount of tank variants. It is
recommended to focus on heavy tanks as they offer great armour and have alright stats. The Hotchkiss light tanks
can be used to exploit breakthroughs and also have great armour for light tanks.

As time goes on however medium and modern tanks become more and more competitive and should become a
essential part of the French army. Any large breakthrough of tanks can prove disastrous for the French army so
having tanks for counter attacking is crucial

Artillery:

France is heavily reliant on heavy variants to provide competitive stats and should try and keep heavy
artillery in the support role. Anti tank guns should be used in every frontline infantry unit and offer very good
penetration and hard attack.

Navy:

The French navy comes with very powerful Frigates, Destroyers and Battleships. Its is recommended to
create a modern navy using these units but existing French cruisers should still be used with them having average
stats. For historical games it is best to specialize in Frigates and destroyers to help out with Anti Sub Warfare as
much as you can.

Aircraft:

The French air force stays **on par with other major nations but doesn’t excel in any particular area**.
Investment in the air force is key and will make it so Britain and other allies can afford to help you in the air war,
providing sheer numbers to protect your country from bombers and enemy air superiority.

Focus Tree:

It is recommended to rush Form the Popular front, and then Nationalize Key Industries. Your priority is to
keep up with Industrial focuses and split time between colonial and military improvement. But do rush political
focuses when you are soon able to extend army budgets and do strengthen the government. Plan V and VII are
crucial to achieve a good sized air and tank force to bypass bad factory output. If you want to play safe as France it
is recommended to do the scale down mechanization focus in the military tree.


Some key focuses that should be rushed are:

```
Global Integration, Nationalize Key Industries, Review National Policy, Merge ministries of war
```
Negative National Spirits:

- Full Employment - Removed after Global Integration
- Disjointed Government - Removed by completing Unify the Government
- Structured Doctrines **–** Removed by doing army reform decisions unlocked by Military Reform
- Static Command **–** Removed from New Military Bureau

Politics:

Gaston Henry, the Silent workhorse should be the first person you pick. Felix Gouin is also a must have
when he is available. It is possible to fully focus on removing disjointed gov and have it gone by May 1940, but it is
best to focus less on it and get essential high command positions filled. However, all efforts must be made to raise
National Unity as that will mean more forces, territory and resources will be available when/if you become Free
France and Germany will suffer from having less compliance.

Construction:

- Focus on doing your contracts.
- Build any forts during wartime.

General Tips:

- Use the Dyle-Breda line to move into Belgium and inflict casualties onto the Germans before they reach
    mainland.
- Do all the missions you start the game with to ensure a fun Free France experience and it will make
    Germany have less compliance from France.
- Having tanks allows for counter attacks, having planes allows a contested air war that will keep army
    defence high.
- Use 4 divisions per tile, have 2 lines of defence and make sure the Maginot and the alpine forts are
    garrisoned with at least 2 divisions per tile.
- Modernize your infantry by giving them plenty of AT.


Italy

Tech Tree:

Infantry:

Italian Light and heavy equipment, much like Italian equipment in general, possess various degrees of
quality. The light equipment in the Beretta line and later Armaguerra has a good amount of soft attack and
breakthrough while being somewhat cheap to produce. And for the elite divisions the Breda M1935 line could be
used if you have the industry for slightly more stats. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said regarding the heavy
infantry equipment. In general, has worse stats and worse reliability compared to all other majors until the late
game. You should try to keep it as modern as possible to not stay completely obsolete.

Where Italy shines however, is in the special forces department**. After doing the “Rebuild the Alpini” focus, you**
get access to 4% more special forces. With that you can build a pretty sizable mountaineer army with good stats,
and even some marines for naval invasions. Before getting tanks, the mountaineers can act as your main
spearhead, as they have good terrain bonuses and are cheaper to produce.

Armour:

Italian armour can be best described as always being behind in stats, but they can become very essential
for grand Italian plans and can be very useful especially if Italy stands alone. The light tank line should be ignored
as it does not provide enough stats, while the first ok medium tank model is the M15. It is not recommended to
use pure medium tanks in your template, as they would lack enough punch for a tank division, instead use a
combination of SPGs and TDs. The heavy tank line on the other hand is much more costly, but also provides with
the most amount of armour and heavy attack.

The Italian mechanized is in general trash. The first mechanized only has 20% hardness, while the next models also
have low hardness. The only model with acceptable stats is the 1945 mech with 60%. For this reason it is
recommended to use trucks until the late game, as the difference in stats is not massive, but is quite the
difference in production. The only option for a good mechanized is to build German mech, which is possible but if
you do it you won't have the same numbers, so it's only recommended if you do a small tank force.

In general, the creation of a tank corps should be low in priority comparison with the other branches of the armed
forces. Is recommended that once the army air force and navy are consolidated, a small tank force with the new
models could be useful once the spare production is reached.

Artillery:

Italy has strong artillery at the start of the game and during most of it, but a very weak AT line, hence the
usage of heavy AA in some divisions could help contain armour thrusts. It's also recommended to always prioritize
AT and later Heavy AT, as those will be essential to defend against enemy tanks. The Italian anti air is also very
weak, which is why its recommended to invest into the air force.

Navy:

The Littorio is an excellent battleship capable of standing toe to toe against the British battle line. But if
you are looking for less expensive options, the heavy cruiser Bolzano is a good all around cruiser capable of
dealing massive damage to any screen line. For screens, any destroyer is good in order to fill the line, but if you
want an screen capable of dealing massive damage, the Duca is the best light cruiser of the axis, with a lot of hp
and massive light attack.


And if your plans are to break free from the Mediterranean cage, carriers will be necessary for Atlantic operations.
Italy isn't known for having the best carriers, with the Sparviero class being mediocre, but you can get access to
the much better Aquilla class that will stay competitive for most of the mid game.

Aircraft:

The Italian aircraft are a mixed bag. The Strike bombers are an excellent early option, as their production
can be started in 1936, and they can act as CAS, naval strike and strategic bombing. The early fighter is
suboptimal, being behind every major. However the 1941 model MC 202 is almost on par with everyone at the
time. In general it is recommended to always build strike bombers at the beginning as they will prove useful all
game, and later transition into fighters during the mid to late game.

Focus Tree:

Italy starts with an outdated army navy and air force. Your number one priority is to gain enough XP to
reform those branches. For that keep your navy training at all times and do the same for the air force, with some
training of the army as well. At the same time your industry is also lacking behind, so some balance must be struck
**between the two. At the start it is recommended that you do the focus “Instituto per la ricostruzione”, which will**
unlock decisions to decrease fatigue, going all the way to the **“Develop Danielle Steel Works” focus, that will grant**
you 3 steel mills. As soon as Ethiopia capitulates you should do Military rearmament as it will grant a massive -
10% Consumer goods. You also need to press the decisions to deal with Ethiopian rebels by leaving some divisions
there.

After that take some political focuses to get political power to start filling your cabinet. When the rebels are dealt
**with, you can do the focus “Topple Amhara rulers” to gain compliance in Ethiopia, which will** fulfil the mission to
**pacify Ethiopia. Subsequently start working on the focus “Corpo Truppe Volontarie” to send volunteers to Spain so
you can start reforming the army. Following this you should focus on the industry path, specifically the “Danielle**
industrial **Complex” which will grant you much nee** ded military factories. After this you can focus on what you
want, if you want a good navy it is recommended that you do the dockyard focuses as soon as possible. In general
try to always fulfil the Mussolini missions as they will give free xp, and to get as many doctrines before getting the
discounts from the focuses.

Some key focuses are:

Instituto per la ricostruzione, Align with German Politics, War of rapid decision, By Blood Alone, The
Corpo Truppe Volontarie and Decima Flottiglia MAS

Negative National Spirits:

- Inadequate armed forces- split into 3, removed after 4 modernization decisions efforts in each area
    using xp
- Grand Council of Fascism **–** Not bad NS, but it can cause a civil war if main land italy gets invaded and
    you haven't finished dictator of italy

Politics:

The first pick should depend on your build, in case you want to build an actual navy you need to leave the
London naval treaty. After that you should get the silent workhouse for 15% pp gain, and the propaganda master
for 10% pp and war support. The remaining advisors don't matter as much, but you should get doctrine advisors


as soon as possible in order to reform the armed forces, and the military factory construction speed. When you
have all of them filled out, get some propaganda so your war support doesn't get too low.

Construction:

- Do not focus on civilian factories, there are too many debuffs and they won't pay for themselves. Instead
    build military factories if you want to focus on the army and air force or dockyards if you want a navy.
- Build radar and a naval base in Southern Sicily to help detect ships and force supply to go through 1 naval
    zone.
- Building fuel silos will help you last longer in the war as fuel sources dwindle very quickly.
- Build steel mills to supply your army/navy.

General Tips:

Have garrison forces at the start of the war to prevent early invasions

Invade Malta and use it to better supply your troops in Africa

Use only the strait of Sicily to supply troops in Africa

Leave the London naval treaty

Build railways, ports and airbases in Africa


Japan

Tech Tree:

Infantry:

**Japanese infantry start with relatively low stats and don’t improve significantly, tech bonuses should still**
be researched but replacing your current production lines of equipment might not be worth the efficiency
reduction you will face. Japan has a national focus early on that will research and give you a new heavy infantry
line, so it is worth to use that.

Armour:

Japanese armour suffers from a general lack of good stats but are very cheap and highly modular, several
tanks can be upgraded with modules from the other tanks you research. The Chi-ha line especially can be
upgraded later on, with progressively better armour, guns and radios while coming early and retaining efficiency.
By 43 however, Japanese tanks improve dramatically and can be almost on par with contemporaries but sacrifice
the low production cost of earlier models. As your main opponent is the Western Allies, armour can be used
effectively against allied infantry and may be required if needing to fight off allied tanks themselves, as you lack
effective land AT.

Artillery:

Japanese artillery barring the first one are some of the best in the game, and are always worth to upgrade
to later models to benefit from the increase to all stats as soon as you can. Unfortunately, that cannot be said of
rest of the tech tree were your AA, AT and heavy AA suffer from low stats compared to other countries, AT should
still be researched to provide added bonus against enemy tanks but should not be relied on solely to pierce or do
enough damage to enemy armour.

Navy:

Much like Japanese tanks, the strongest part of the Japanese navy is its modularity, old ships can be made
**more useful with upgrades from later down the line and some of Japan’s strongest ships are actually its older**
models. The Tone, Amagi, Takao, and th **e Mogami are all “out of date” ships but** still remain on par if not better to
newer models, change their designs to have better guns, armour and engines and they make effective ships, while
**cheaper than designs like the Yamato. On the carrier side, Japanese carriers don’t have the best HP or deck size**
but above average on both, especially with the Shokaku carrier. Their light carriers can also be cheap alternatives
to supplement your fleet. Japanese screens are the worst of the bunch, but benefit from high torpedo attack and
relatively cheap especially their frigate lines which are the most effective counter to Submarines.

Aircraft:

Japanese aircraft have the biggest leap in effectiveness, early models are abysmal in almost all stats, but in
40 - 41 effective models in carrier fighter, Carrier CAS, tactical bombers, and naval bombers all come out. Compared
to other nations they still lack in several stats, but make up for it superior ranges able to cover the pacific front
and India effectively especially considering the low amount of airfields you will find.


Focus Tree:

Japan has plenty of good choices to choose from there focus tree. The left and middle side give you
political and industry bonuses that are vital for long term build up and fighting China early on. The puppet projects
provide PP while also giving decisions to the industry to those countries that also come back to you and allow
them to be more effective. Purging the Kodoha faction is the most important starting focus but afterwards a focus
on getting political power and industry is recommended. The national defence state opens up a lot of factories on
**the left side of the tree and should be picked and focused towards, while later on picking Konoe’s second term**
and Tojo after their date locks are required to progress industrially and declare on the allies.

Negative National Spirits:

- Gekokujo - **Removed after following the national focuses Konoe’s second term unlocks**.
- Duplicae Air research - Removed by completing The Imperial Japanese Airforce
- Navy slighted- acquired after starting the war with China, makes naval invasions impossible and can only
    be removed after its time limit runs out.
- Political turmoil- acquired after Konoe resigns and can only be gotten rid of after his second term focus is
    picked after the time limit.

Politics:

Essential Ministers:

```
Chief of army, Prince Kan’in Kotohito
```
```
Political advisor, Mitsumasa Yonai
```
```
Foreign minister, Shigenori Togo
```
```
Intelligence minister, Kingoro Hashimoto
```
```
Army theorist, Kanji Ishiwara
```
```
Interior Minister, Koichi Kido, after the co prosperity sphere. Michio Yuzawa after appoint Tojo
```
Other ministers:

```
Industrial concern, Sumitomo (to build steel, infra and railways) Idemitsu Kosan (for fuel silos
```
```
and refineries)
```
```
Transport minister, Takuo Godo or Chikuhei Nakajima (Nakajima is best almost always)
```
```
Economic minister, Machida Chuji, or Ikeda Shigeaki (Chuji if you want to switch to limited
```
```
exports)
```
Construction:

Japan struggles with fighting a war in China while also preparing for the war against the allies later on, two
different objectives that require military factories and dockyards. Resources are also a problem especially steel
and aluminium especially if you focus more on capitals. Start off with some steel mills and then going to some
military factories allows a proper build up for China, but by late 37 you should be building dockyards to an amount
you are comfortable with that allows an effective naval force. Before you seize Indochina, you should also think of
building fuel silos to stockpile fuel against the allies as you will be embargoed afterwards.


General Tips:

Have strong garrison forces at the start of the war with the allies to prevent early invasions

Keep the Invasions going in the allies, your biggest chance of winning in the pacific will be in the first 6
months.

Due the state of the Japanese army and the supply situation in China, it is not recommended to invade
China with that many 30wdith divisions. It is better to think of your 30 widths as elite pushing divisions and create
a front-line division template that is smaller and cheaper to fill the front line while the 30 widths push. While the
30width should be full heavy infantry and support companies the line holder should be about 12-18 width with
some light infantry and artillery just to hold the line, upgrade it later on but if you plan to push into China, you
need to start the war with as many divisions as you can recruit even if it means making them worse at the start.

The Chinese war allows you to mobilise, take bonds and progress in your focus tree industrially. Taking Jinan,
Wuhan, and Nanjing as well as all their ports gives you 150 PP and factory output for each objective. Make sure to
fight the Chinese constantly to grind good generals and xp for doctrines. China has low supply and get the guerilla
warfare state debuff that significantly makes it harder to advance into China, be careful not to overextend and
**don’t expect to capitulate China nor is it necessary to fi** ght the allies.

Garrison Infantry:

3 heavy Infantry

3 light infantry

```
1 Artillery
```
Engineers, maintenance


Germany

Tech Tree:

Infantry:

German Light and heavy equipment are some of the best in the game. At the beginning of the game the
Kar98 is a good cost effective weapon. Later the split between the Stg44 and the Gewehr comes down to stats vs
production and it's up to you to decide which one is better or if you want both.

The Mg34 is one of the best starting machine guns, and with the newer models, it will get cheaper with more hard
attack. Afterwards the Mg42 offers excellent soft attack, and the versions with the panzerfaust and panzerschreck
will cover for the hard attack. However you can skip the MG34+Panzerbuchse 38 if you lack heavy equipment.

Special forces are not very common for Germany, as you rely mainly on tanks for the spearhead. However
paratroopers can be very useful. You can get a free paratrooper focus by doing the Fallschirmjäger focus, and they
can be used on the invasion of Norway, making France capitulate faster or even to make encirclements on the
Soviet Union. Marines can also be useful in case of a Sea Lion, but they will require a bigger investment in terms of
xp.

Armour:

**Germany’s armor is some of the most infamous pieces of WW2. Initially you have 2 types of tanks, the**
Panzer 4 that focuses on the soft attack, and the Panzer 3 which focuses on hard attack, and you should combine
both to have a balanced template. While they lack piercing and armor early on, they have speed and doctrine
which allows them to beat enemy tanks. German mechanized is also very good, with the line splitting in 1941 with
the new model being cheap, but you have to be careful since it's a new production line.

Later on German tanks catch up in firepower and armor. You can upgrade the old panzer 4s laying around to the
newer Panzer 4G with the bigger gun, or modernize the arsenal with the new Panther Tanks. Another option is the
Tiger heavy tank, which can lead the feared King Tiger. Either way fuel is a massive issue for Germany, so you have
to pursue a policy of quality over quantity.

Artillery:

German artillery and AA is in general pretty good. However the initial line of anti tank is somewhat
lacking. It is recommended that you prioritize research of the newer models until you reach the pak 40, which is
one the best ATs in the game. A very special piece of equipment is the Flak 88, which with its high piercing allows
it to penetrate the early enemy tanks with high armor. In general it's recommended to invest on all tree lines,
prioritizing the at.

Navy:

The Kriegsmarine has a very interesting arsenal. While lacking in the carrier department until the Europa
class, they have some of the best submarines and battleships. Due to this, there are two options you can do: The
classic trade interdiction with submarines and some surface ships like the Panzerchiffs or Plan Z, with a big
investment on battleships and later carriers to take down the Royal Navy.

German destroyers and light cruisers have some of the highest HP so they can be used in both functions. If you
want to invest into a navy it is recommended to do naval rearmament and get the naval dockyards from the focus


as soon as possible, and in order to rebuild the high seas fleet you will need to do the focus Reap the London
Naval treaty.

Aircraft:

The Luftwaffe has quite the amount of options. The Stuka is a classic for a cas, with the new versions
getting even better with time, but the Heinkel is also quite versatile for a tactical bomber. With regards to fighters
early on you should use the BF line, a fighter that stays competitive until 1941. After that the BF line starts
dropping in quality in comparison to the other majors.

At this point you should have enough industry to start the production of the multirole FW line, and slowly
transition from the BF to only having FWs in the air force. To stop allied bombers some few heavy fighters and
attackers will be essential as they have very high air attack. Due to being outnumbered it is always recommended
you convert older models to newer ones. Investment in jet aircraft can also help bridging this gap

Focus Tree:

Germany's focus tree works differently than other majors. Because of the military rearmament, you are on
a time clock before your economy collapses. There are a lot of focuses to complete in a short amount of time so
**you should be careful. Initially do “Rhineland” and “Proclaim the Axis powers”, then go to the industry focus and
appoint Hermann Goering until you get to “Deutsche Arbeitsfront”. After that wait until the Spanish civil war
starts so you can send volunteers by doing “The condor legion” focus.**

After that, celebrate the Olympics and form the SS. Subsequently the order doesn't matter as much, just
**remember to do the “Reichautobahn” focus and “Expand the KDF organization”. The moment you research the**
first BF fighter, make an production line by doi **ng “Volskwagen scheme” and “Nationalize German Arms** Industry **”**
all the way until the extra research slot. When you start ramming refinery production in late 1938, you should
invest in the IG Farben focus.

Use the doctrine bonuses from the focus after you already spent some XP in getting the tier 1 doctrines.
Remember to always train divisions so you can be on time for Anschluss, Demand Sudetenland and Danzig or war.
With the reminder that you need 1,5 million men on the field to attack Poland.

Some key focuses are:

Blomberg-Fritsch Affair, Synthetic breakthrough, Volskwagen scheme, Merge the Steel industries,
Exploitation of acquired resources, Mobilize the workforce, Plan the Third Generation, Prioritize the FW, Atlantik
Wall, Secure Swedish iron, Appoint Albert Speer (available after feb 1942) and Rustungsstab committee.

Negative National Spirits:

Economic Divide - Removed after going down either economic focus trees

```
Relaxed Industry - Removed by mobilize the workforce
```
```
Inefficient Air Industry – Removed from reform the ministry of Aviation in the Luftwaffe tree
```
```
Limited Agency Powers – Removed from Downfall of the Solf Kreis
```

Politics:

Your first pp pick should be Joseph Goebbles for the pp gain. After that you should get Martin Bormann
for the extra 15% pp. When you form the SS, press the decision to get Himmel field command, and it will point
him as an advisor. Appointing Hermann Goering will also auto select him, but you want to use him temporarily to
gain pp until you can switch to Walther Funk, who is a better advisor to build up the military. After that pick up
military advisors and theorists

Construction:

- Focus purely on military buildings and ignore civilian factories entirely.
- The next most important building is synthetic refineries otherwise you will run out of fuel and rubber.
- It is worthwhile to consider some early infrastructure investments in Westfalen and Niedersachsen
- After you mobilize the workforce and go to war economy you should conscript man into the factories in
    order to maximize your output before the start of the invasion of the Soviet Union.
- After barb it is recommended to invest into anti air and an Atlantik wall

General Tips:

- Make use of the Reichskommissariats, as they will alleviate the pressure on the garrisons.
- Use all war bounds before exploiting conquered territories, to maximize the amount of factories you get,
    as when you exploit a country their factories get damaged.
- Ensure a good Atlantik wall is presented before you start barb
- Quality and strategy will win the war for Germany, maximize your early build as the longer you take to
    win the harder it will be to defeat your enemies,
- Make sure to build fuel silos before barb starts, as your fuel will get completely drain during the invasion.
    The minimum recommended is at least 3 million fuel stockpiled, so you don't run out of it during the
    battles.
- Mobilize as soon as possible, get war economy as soon as you declare war, and get Speer in early 1942.
    Ideally you want to be as strong as possible early on, when your enemies haven't had time to adapt yet.
- If playing in multiplayer, invest in counter intelligence straight away


Soviet Union

Tech Tree:

Infantry:

Soviet light equipment is very cheap early on and you should always be producing it through 1942 with
the aim of always keeping a large stockpile, therefore it is recommended you always have 2 lines of production
with one being the Mosin Nagant and the other being SVT for your elite/tank divisions. Early Soviet heavy
equipment however is expensive and has bad stats and there it should be switched to the DS 39

Soviet equipment have average stats but excel in breakthrough. However this can only really be made use of after
reforms are complete.

Armour:

Soviet Tanks on paper look great, good armour and good firepower. However many lack the ergonomics of
other nations aswell as radios and good vision ports. Therefore they frequently run into high casualties due to
very poor breakthrough and defence. It is advisable to keep them from frontline action until they are absolutely
needed, atleast early on.

Keep upgrading your models as eventually they will fix many of their problems, pair them up with tank destroyers
and assault guns to overcome there shortfalls and the Soviet tanks can become really strong. The one consistently
shining grace of the Soviet tanks are there cheap cost and excellent armour so it is advisable to invest into heavy
tanks at one point

Artillery:

Soviet Artillery has good stats and should be used to help counter their poor military performance against
major nations. The Soviets specialize in rocket artillery which provide excellent breakthrough stats that can
seriously buff the performance of elite infantry or tank divisions. Otherwise it is key to produce anti tank weapons
and equip your whole army with them as well as AA. Overall a well rounded template will keep the front as strong
as possible

Navy:

The Red Navy is very outdated and small, In order to overcome these shortcomings the Soviets have very
powerfull battleships. However if you do not foresee yourself engaging in many naval combats it is advisable to
invest into an escort and submarine fleet to guard your own convoys and main strategic naval zones respectively

Aircraft:

The Red air force is heavily dependent on having large numbers to compensate for their Red airforce
maluses. Strike and Tactical bombers, aswell as attackers can be useful when airfields are getting bombed, but it is
always recommended to go down the CAS line due to how effective they are. The LA line offer the best stats while
the Yak line gives good range and cheap cost, choose wisely.

Your ground forces are very dependent on airpower to not suffer huge losses due to a lack of SPAA and so always
keep your air lines at the start of the game because if quality **won’t** cut it, quantity will.


Focus Tree:

The Soviet Focus tree is all about expansion and industrialization. 5 year plans must be prioritized and
done ASAP. Outside of them, it is a priority to focus on your political tree when it comes to the great purge and
socialist realism.

Outside of industry and politics you can take focuses as you fancy, with the only exception being lessons of war
and split the commissariat of defence industry which should be taken as soon as possible. It is recommended to
do each military tree before war starts and after war Stavka and the great patriotic war must be taken. One focus
after Stavka allows you to continue artillery and at progression and so must be prioritized.

Some key focuses are:

Urbanize the urals, Lessons of war, form the Stavka, great patriotic war, defence of the motherland, ask
for aid, positive heroism

Negative National Spirits:

Trotsky Plot - Removed after completing behead the snake

```
Widespread Army Incompetence – Removed by army reforms decisions
```
Airforce Incompetence - Removed by air reforms decisions

Naval Incompetence - Removed by naval reforms decisions

```
Cavalry Army Clique – Removed by army reforms decision twice (or once if activating order 227) and
completing the focus Disband the Cavalry Army Clique
```
Aftershock of Holodomor **–** Removed by iteslf after time runs out

Peoples commissariat of defence industry **–** Improved through focuses.

Soviet Industry **–** Improved through focuses

Politics:

The SU lacks pp gain early on and must be used wisely. Your early aims should be to get attache **’** s to Spain
and China while focusing on minister who grant pp like Nikita Khrushchyov and Vyacheslav Molotov. It is highly
recommended to pick Lazar Kaganovich and then a military advisor ASAP once you have the political ministers.

Many of the Soviet expansions are dealt through decisions rather than war justification so make sure you have a
pp stockpile when France falls Remember to complete your faction missions as they offer huge pp rewards that
can be used to fill out your high command.

Construction:

- Focus firstly on building civilian factories to complete the second five year plan.
- After that focus should only be on military factories, however be mindful of terrible state modifiers when
    you go east of Moscow so focus construction in the west, particularly in places that have high
    infrastructure. ( **don’t** worry they can be evacuated later)


- Invest in airfields on the Moscow-Stalingrad line in case you get pushed that deep once war starts

General Tips:

Do not leave your entire army on the frontline, keep multiple fall back lines around defensible river lines.

```
Have your good armour ready along side your fallback lines to prevent Germany from exploiting
breakthroughs in your frontline.
```
```
The Caucasus are more valuable than Moscow
```
```
Scorch earth and evacuate frontline industry ASAP
```
```
Remember to do rebuild the army decisions to replace any major losses
```

United Kingdom

Tech Tree:

Infantry:

British Light and heavy infantry equipment is good and reliable but does not get great upgrades. It is
recommended to leave a few mills on them to modernize your infantry and rely on US cash and carry or lend lease
to expand your infantry. Special Forces tech is highly recommended as Britain gets great bonuses for them in both
the focus tree and high command

Armour:

British tanks have amongst the highest armour or speed during the early and mid game. A high reliance on
both of these will lead to your opponent to develop specific and expensive equipment to counter them. Generally
as Britain you will lack firepower, equip your medium tanks with heavy artillery or infantry support tanks and your
heavy tanks with SPGs mitigates this.

Rely on support tanks (Valentines) to make up the numbers if you go for a heavy tank only build. Building
mechanized equipment for your tank divisions is not viable early on so make sure to assign 5-10 mills on trucks

Artillery:

British Artillery can be best described as good enough to get the job done. Their Anti tank guns are quite
good however, early anti air adoption can be great to counter air superiority from the Germans.

Navy:

The royal navy has some of the best light cruisers and excellent capital ship models, however due to the
London naval treaty your next BBs and CVs are severely restricted in armament and size. To build them you have
to rely on your decisions.

It is important to refit your ships even the ones you will be building up to the lead up to the war to help protect
against enemy naval air.

Your biggest enemy however is going to be enemy submarines and an effort must be made to keep up to date
with your frigate and destroyer research. Starting with the hunt class you have an excellent sub hunting and
escort ship for early game. After researching the Q/R class destroyers become your primary sub hunting fleet.
Flowers are the most cost-effective escort ship and rivers an supplement either one.

Aircraft:

The British air tree offers very competitive planes, it is recommended to go down both the fighter and
multirole lines and build naval bombers with patrol planes an tactical bombers. The spitfires are a great
superiority plane, the multiroles give CAS and will also supplement your fighter air count which is essential to not
suffering from the effect of being outnumbered. Once you have your footing in 1941/42 you can start building
bombers and escorts. British bombers have some of the best bomb loadouts and can make a big impact on the
war.


Focus Tree:

The British focus tree is a mix of rearmament and fortifications. It is important to first focus on addressing
the great depression and rushing balance of power with shadow scheme. Afterwards plan the next imperial
conference and do the first focuses of all 3 military branches. You can then be free to develop the commonwealth
and do other focuses. It is recommended not to rush your rearming focuses as while they may be available, not
waiting for higher world tension will lead to sever stability losses.

Before war starts make sure to do your fortifications in the Mediterranean first and as for rearming, aim for the
Royal tank corps, chief of staff committee and Royal Ordinance factories.

Once war starts rush focuses that reduce/get rid of your war to end all wars National spirit.

Some key focuses to rush are:

```
War Works, British Commonwealth Air training Plan, Civil Defence, British Professionalism
```
Negative National Spirits:

The War to End all wars - Removed after the Military Training Act

High Imports **–** Removed by Mending the Trade

Politics:

An early choice for Britain is to rush anyone who gives political power. Then get your industrial concern
and Income tax cuts before filling out theorists. You can also afford to pick a Economic minister before your war
industrialist becomes available

Construction:

- Start of the game by building a few aluminium and steel mills
- Once you have unlocked the shadow scheme switch focus to civilian factories
- After General rearmament focus only on military factories

General Tips:

As the UK you should aim for expanding your tank and plane numbers. Keep infantry to a minimum

```
Never underestimate the possibility of Sealion. Therefore, leave a garrison and naval force around the UK
at all times with dedicated mining ships and tanks.
```
Ensure Gibraltar and the Egyptian/Palestinian ports are well guarded.

```
Have a fleet covering the East African coast to catch any Italian naval invasions until it is secured by
ground forces.
```
You will not be able to outproduce convoy losses by just spamming convoys, ASW is essential.

```
Make sure to build radar stations and use air power to help with detecting and killing submarines/naval
invasions.
```

United States of America

Tech Tree:

Infantry:

The USA starts with one of the best light infantry and heavy infantry equipment in the game, (its only in 43
that Germany gets comparable to both) and although stat increases to them over the years are insubstantial, they
retain efficiency so there is little reason not to upgrade.

Armour:

American armour is virtually non-existent until 1942, but afterwards receives extremely solid options to all
classes. American Meccanized is comparable to German mechanized and their tanks designs although not the best
are very solid in all regards, their SPGs especially benefit heavily from US unique technologies and doctrine. US
piercing can be relatively low even if using TDs and you might find it difficult to pierce the heavy tanks variants
that can be used by the axis.

Artillery:

American artillery (both light and heavy) is poor in the pre war years but by 41 becomes average and
above average with US doctrines. Their AT lags behind at all time and it is better to use your TD variants in the
armour tree. American AA is the only are **a they excel and can deliver high air attack but aren’t useful as frontal**
support units.

Navy:

The American navy boasts the best of several lines, combining excellent stats while maintaining low build
cost especially with the reductions you can stack in the focuses and MIOs. American light cruisers are the best of
their line and boast superior armour and light attack. While their Heavy cruisers and Battleships also boast
superior light and heavy attack and their carriers have the highest deck size. With the resources available to the
US especially a focus on capital ships when they are buildable is highly recommended, and refits to existing ships
as the pre war classes remain solid choices to bring to either the Pacific or Atlantic oceans.

Aircraft:

The American Airforce takes some time to become strong but once it does it boasts some of the best
planes of their type. By 1942/43 American CAS and strike bombers boast very high ground attack, their planes
have high agility and air attack all the while keeping ranges that are needed in the pacific. American Naval
bombers and Carrier CAS also have exceptionally good naval attack to be used in carriers or fleet bombing
operations. And of course, American strategic bombers boast high strategic bombing and ranges needed in the
pacific and to hit Axis minors like Hungary or Romania.

Focus Tree:

The American focus tree in the pre war years primarily focuses on getting rid of the great depression,
lowering fatigue and reducing the negative spirits are essential to build the infrastructure required for getting rid
of it entirely. Several key focuses to then mobilise your economy and help the allies like cash and carry and


Lendlease act are essential to supporting the allies and the soviets. Once war starts you have several focuses to
further expand military production and cooperate with the European allies.

Key prewar focuses:

Budget Balancing, cash and carry act, Hatch Act, Quarantine policy, Declare limited national emergency,
the giant wakes.

Key post war focuses:

Arcadia Conference, proximity fuse, war production board

Negative National Spirits:

Political corruption **–** Removed after doing the Hatch Act

Segregated Army Divisions **–** Removed after the full desegregation focus

Torpedo crisis **–** removed with decisions and time

Inefficient Airforce **–** removed doing the air force focus trees under pentagon

Great depression **–** Giant wakes and doing the on state decisions after building 8 infra in all states

Politics

Ministers in order of importance

Robert taft **–** 15% pp
John Winant **–** 10% pp
Harold Ickes **–** 10% pp
Daniel Roper **–** captain of industry (replace with war industrialist when building mil
William & Elizabeth Smith **–** cryptologists
General electric **–** infra build speed (replace with GM or standard oil after infra is built)
Chief of army **–** replace depending on the doctrine you want to do

Construction:

- Finishing your infra construction should be the only priority at the start of the game.
- Afterwards the USA can pretty much do anything, but a heavy focus on aluminium mills and synthetic
    refineries for rubber is recommended.

General tips

- Due the hue amount of civilian factories that the US has, anything can be built and much like historically
    cheaper alternatives can be ignored, replace anti tank guns with Tank destroyers, replace infantry with
    mechanized for the speed and health upgrades. The US may not have the best tank divisions or the best
    infantry but it makes up for it in the diversity it can afford to produce,
- You can leave regular leg infantry just for island garrisons.
- Concentrate on your strengths as well which predominantly is excellent soft attack, SPGs and Heavy arty
    can be formidable especially in garrison or mechanized divisions.
- Remember to have the minimum requirement of ships for power projection and embargoes against Japan
- You can be dragged into war early if the UK falls so have some divisions ready in 194 0
- Be prepared to keep large stockpiles for Cash and Carry/Lend Lease. Do not ignore Soviet and UK aid
    decisions.


Canada

Tech Tree:

Infantry:

*Same as United Kingdom

Armour:

*Same as United Kingdom

Artillery:

*Same as United Kingdom

Navy:

*Same as United Kingdom

Aircraft:

*Same as United Kingdom

Focus Tree:

The primary focus at the beginning should be on the industry and later the crown **corporation’s** tree.
Decide very quickly whether you want to abolish the RTC or expand it as you want to make the most gains of
either side, that being having higher stab or constructing more buildings. Once that decisions has been made it is
recommended to get the Canadian broadcasting corporation to increase stability.

**Make sure to do the focus “The Plan” before war starts as that helps the UK immensely. During wartime it is best**
to focus on finishing the air tree and spending time on naval focuses, outside of that you should try and finish the
rearmament section by 1942 which will unlock your resource focuses which is a massive boon to the allies.

Some key focuses to rush are:

```
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, The Plan, Permanent Joint Defence Board, Victory aircraft limited
```
Negative National Spirits:

Peace keeping force - Removed after National Resources Mobilization Act

Conscription crisis **–** Removed from Compromise with Quebec


Politics:

A good choice is always to pick political advisors first, afterwards focus on getting theorists and then
income tax cuts.

Construction:

- Start of the game by building aluminium mills
- Once you have finished limited rearmament you can start building military factories

General Tips:

As Canada, your airpower is your key contribution, and it is an important one in early game


British Raj

Tech Tree:

Infantry:

*Same as United Kingdom

Armour:

*Same as United Kingdom

Artillery:

*Same as United Kingdom

Navy:

*Same as United Kingdom

Aircraft:

*Same as United Kingdom

Focus Tree:

As historical India, your goal is to remain as a subject of the United Kingdom and provide as much military,
material and civilian aid to the war effort. Your primary focus is the industry tree, attract British investors and set
up new industry straight away. Afterwards you can go down your political tree (very important to do this before
the timer runs out) and go down the government of India act. Collaborating with the Hindu Mahasabha is crucial
to get good state modifiers to build in

Your army tree is the most important one out of the three trees but it is highly recommended to do naval focuses
that give dockyards and air focuses that improve your agrarian level.

Some key focuses to rush are:

```
Expand the Executive Council, Revise Indian Defence Plans, Indian State forces.
```
Negative National Spirits:

- Marginalized Muslim Community **–** Improved via Lahore Resolution
- Indian National Congress **–** Is improved after the Quit India movement fails
- Tax evasion **–** Removed after establishing the reserve bank of India


Politics:

As the Raj, most of your political power will be spent on decisions to keep stability and war support high.
After Expand the executive council you will have access to new ministers that you can appoint to replace current
ones who give major stability penalties.

The quit India movement will gain momentum in 1942 and riots will begin. It is recommended to save up atleast
300 political power to deal with it

Construction:

- Start of the game by building steel mills
- You will need to build infrastructure to remove agrarian modifiers but it is unachievable early on due to
    many negative modifiers. Use the Hindu Mahasabha to gain good bonuses and only focus on a few states
    that have the most population to gain maximum reward for any investment
- Outside of some infrastructure and steel milsl you should focus on military factories once rearmament
    begins

General Tips:

- As Raj your main contribution is manpower and divisions, help the UK by garrisoning important states like
    Aden and provide support where needed
